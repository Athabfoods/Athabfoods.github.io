  <h3>Project 4 - Dusk Till Dawn Energy Systems (On site energy production)</h3>
  
    Create needed energy on site. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <!--***-->Sustainability is acheived by removing uncontrollable costs. Utilities are exactly that. Being truly sustainable actually means going off-grid.
    <br>
    <br>
    We intend to test several designs of energy storage and energy generation for feasibility north of Edmonton. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Solar may make sense in the summer or down south. It certainly doesn't make sense here where there is only 5 to 6 hours of sunlight a day.

<h3>
  Ukraine and energy:
</h3>

      After seeing the energy crisis in Ukraine I decided that if power production is feasible (legally), all extra power generated will be given to the grid for free. 
      <br>
      <br>
      This will help reduce energy costs locally because the grid operator will not have to produce that energy themselves... 
<p>

    We are never going to sell energy that is made by nature.

<h3>
 Why can we afford to be so generous?: 
</h3>

  There are many aspects to this. At the end of 10 years we will have tested and worked out the bugs of more than 5 projects that are well researched. 
  <br>
  <br>
  If we are successful we will have created half a dozen conpanies that produce food for as close to free as possible. The location of the tests, if successful, will make further implementation able to be closer to where people live in the north. 
  <br>
  <br>
    
  And once the equipment is paid for, overhead drops to a low amount.

    <br>
    <br>

    When you are able to grow food in ways that are self supprting and you are no longer worried about re occuring costs. Overhead goes to a minimum which means more can be done to offer customers better value and reduced costs. 
    <br>
    <br>
  By removing huge reccuring costs it is easier to keep people employed during recession cycles.
