Cogeneration provides heating and cooling, CO2 to boost plant growth, and electricity. The energy produced is 90+% efficient thanks to ***Cummins Cogeneration technology.

Any extra energy will be given to the grid for free or for minimal costs.
Closed-loop means that nothing will be coming into the facility at all.

My research is based upon literature that shows smaller stages of this design working very well.

Wastes are mitigated by composting, by feeding other products, and by bio-digestion to fuel power genration.
Project 4
Create needed energy on site.

Sustainability is acheived by removing uncontrollable costs. Utilities are exactly that. Being truly sustainable actually means going off-grid.

We intend to test several designs of energy storage and energy generation for feasibility north of Edmonton.

Solar may make sense in the summer or down south. It certainly doesn't make sense here where there is only 5 to 6 hours of sunlight a day.
Summary:
Alegedly we lose up to 70% during shipping so they grow 70% more to account for those loses. This won't need to be true anymore if food is grown locally. Saving us space required to grow that same amount of food because the amount of space we will need to replace that production locally is significantly less. 50-70% less .
Combined, these projects are able to bring food production closer to our grocery stores in several cost efficent ways. With strategy and technology combined we can reduce many costs, costs that were historically necessary for us to enjoy certain foods year round locally.

Never before have we had this combination of technologies available to us. The ability for us to automate and monitor our gardens remotely is unparalleled thanks to COVID. Allowing individuals and families more freedom while reducing costs of labour and resources are certainly assets in some way.

Additionally, well tested FTEF is available to glaze our greenhouses. At 1/100th the weight of glass we are able to build the greenhouse normally, as if it had to hold up all that glass and then use the ultra-light ETFE instead giving us immemse weight supporting potential. In turn we support rows of automated verticle rotation garden systems from the roof structure. Doing this will also give room for extra rows of food in the ground underneath. Combined we can maximize food produced with free sunlight and can even be put these in normal greenhouses.

The ability to produce food constantly means fewer months, if any, are spent not growing food for the market. This increases year end production significantly because 6 months aren't shut down for winter. Then seed in the spring and have to wait months to reap the benifits leaving upto 9 months a year not producing unless you use energy to spring and fall heat.

On land water collection in hilly areas can save water in ponds and provide it for winter useage for the cost of pumping it.

By allowing UV light in we have a naturally stabilized and sanitized grow environment. Plants are able to protect themselves outside better for this reason and this is typically why infestations and other issues hit greenhouses in the first place, light filtration.

As we know with LEDs, better light means better plants. UV light is a natural sterilizer keeping our qir and water sterilized which we oxygenate to ensure optimal root zone health.

Living soil allows the roots to do what they are designed to do, support the plant. In nature this is automatic. Sadly for years we knew very little as to why this is the case. We now know that the roots communicate through mycelium

They are able to warn other plants of disease and selectively grow their roots or not to allow better chance or not for other plants to take hold.

Roots send signals to microbes and through a complicated chain of interactions involving Humic and Fulvic acids, nutrints and water are express delivered through root membranes and into the plant.

Microbes breakdown dirt transforming unusable nutrients and minerals into everything a plant needs to defend it self, feed it self, and keep itself healthy.

Living soil is by far the most benifical. Although the magic truly happens when a person combines all these techniques together.

Removing long distance shipping costs as much as possible is important in reducing food prices and reducing resource damands enough to matter.

Groceries account for more of our monthly purchase budget than almost any other item we buy in stores combined. It cost a ton to feed a family for the year.

Being able to grow plants with no worries for super cheap is critical for our futures... unless you want to eat bugs. I know I don't.

Eggs, Chicken and milk are major sales items in grocery stores. Providing these closer helps saves money and resources also.

Creating farms that aren't in debt when a farmer starts production will greatly reduce food prices for lack of major overhead right from the start. A farm that starts out of debt and prices their food accordingly prices their food for way less because they won't have to reduce prices once the mortgage is paid off.

Food systems that compliment each other are able to provide more cost savings on top of not needing external feed sources because these are purchases and that is money out thus cost added to food sale price.

Closed-Loop production close to the mouths that eat is clear in in its advantages.

We also can go verticle in southern windows of highrises. Knock out sections of floor near the widows and build the systems between a new wall and the glass keeping most of the office space available (able to see the plants through windows if desired). All while utilizing the huge area of south facing highrise windows and the sun they get. This even helps reduce summer cooling costs.

I cant give any more details away without hindering my own business abilities.

The rest of this site is an in depth look at all that I have said. I have more information as well as resources galore to help in many topics. Mostly food production and energy, also other things like website building, water pumping for free, electrical learing, free education resources, cources from major universities and colleges, addiction stuff, community stuff, and more.
