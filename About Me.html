        A bit about me and my horticulture and soil science skills:
      </h2>
           
        <p>
        I have learnt alot over the last 15 years while growing <a href="https://www.royalqueenseeds.com/blog-veganic-cannabis-cultivation-takes-organic-to-a-whole-new-level-n332" target=""blank"> Cannabis Veganically </a> for medical purposes. The lessons taught there transfer into food production with astonishing results.

          What I bring:
      </h3>
        
        <p>Knowledge, lots of it... I love learning. As a pass time, I research. It is what I enjoy doing most when bored. Since leaving school in 2000 I have read and watched many aspects of sustainability in general. My focus is on energy and the garden as well as in and around the farm.

       <h3>
        Why am I the one for the job?
        </h3>
        
       <p>
       Because in the past, before it was legal, without a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_to_Cannabis_for_Medical_Purposes_Regulations#:~:text=Medical%20cannabis%20was%20first%20legalized,medical%20purposes%20would%20be%20permitted." target=""blank">MMAR</a> to grow cannabis, growing it was always a competition and challenge to see who could make the best tasting buds that got you the most baked. When I discovered <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/subcools-super-soil-step-by-step/" target=""blank">SubCool's Soil</a> Recipe, I was hooked. 
       </p>
       
       <p>
       It was a chance I am glad I took because I discovered how much soil life matters is equally important to what that soil life is processing.

    <h3>
      What I have learnt to date:
    </h3>
      
      <ol>
       <li>
        Nutrients (fertilizers) are equal to amendments in these setups. What certain amendments do to the quality of plants is beyond comprehension. 
       </li>
       <br>
       <li>
         Plants grow quickly once life is in the soil.</li>
        <br>
        <li>They are immune to windy days.</li> 
        
        <li>They no longer need supports for heavy fruit. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Fruit growth is maximized, something that makes harvest time a true joy to see.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Veganic soil makes plants immune to frosts also. I have had hot pepeers see a half dozen frosts with soil life and still have leaves and the actual peppers be firm and not drooping afterwards. Then we tried it with tomatoes and same thing. Frost no longer ruins the plant the first time as half dozen is the number that plants survive too. Sadly the fruit of the tomatoes were only 25% good. But that is better than losing it all, which is what typocally happens on the first or second frost.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Overwatering is not an issue. We had a month where it rained over 600 mm, which is almost a years worth, and our plants still thrived during it.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Underwatering is something I know doesn't matter thanks to indoor growing. Fortunately so far I have not dealt with droughts outside since starting these tests in the garden.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
         This type of gardening has potential to offer real problem solving solutions to growers of any kind. </li>
        <br>
        <li>
       Personally knowing the results of subcool's veganics mix on cannabis for over 10 years along side the last few years of bringing those ideas to the garden tell me that food production can benefit commercially in ways that can impact costs dramatically.</li>
       <br>
       <li>Why? because cannabis buds are technically flowers, which is the part that fruits on edible plants.</li>
       <br>
