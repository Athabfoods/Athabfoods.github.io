        A bit about me and my horticulture and soil science skills:
      </h2>
           
        <p>
        I have learnt alot over the last 15 years while growing <a href="https://www.royalqueenseeds.com/blog-veganic-cannabis-cultivation-takes-organic-to-a-whole-new-level-n332" target=""blank"> Cannabis Veganically </a>and for medical purposes. The lessons learnt there have transferred into food production with astonishing results.

      <h3>
          What I bring:
      </h3>
        
        <p>Knowledge, lots of it... I love learning. As a pass time, I research. It is what I enjoy doing most when I'm bored.
        <br>
        Through reading tons and watching plenty, I have crossed many categories of data in many areas from general knowlege and sciences to complex things like ***human evelotionary biology. Even though the internet can be full of BS, it also has countless resources that are more than usuful. For the most part, <a href="./Learning Learning and Sharing.html">these are the resources</a> I venture to most often.

       <h3>
        Why am I the one for the job?
        </h3>
        
       <p>
       Because in the past, before it was legal, without a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_to_Cannabis_for_Medical_Purposes_Regulations#:~:text=Medical%20cannabis%20was%20first%20legalized,medical%20purposes%20would%20be%20permitted." target=""blank">MMAR</a> to grow cannabis, growing it was always a competition and challenge to see who could make the best tasting buds that got you the most baked. When I discovered <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/subcools-super-soil-step-by-step/" target=""blank">SubCool's Super Soil</a> theory and recipe, I was hooked. I had discovered a super cost effective way to grow enormous, delicious tasting buds that rained thc when shook. And it was surprisingly simple. As weird as it is to say, soil matters incredibly, sure aquaponics grows slightly quicker but the over head in that is constant and huge. A good living pot of soil that is maintained as such lasts for several grows before needing slight amending. Things like calcium and magnesium to name a couple are in high demand when fruiting and so those are a constant and maintaining life is as easy as top dressing the base with compost, kitchen scrapes or lawn clippings / leaves once in a while (make sure to keep top dressings away from the trunk of the tree, they can cause rot problems if too think or if touching the tree at all. <b>Keep back a few inches.<b> 
       </p>
       
       <p>
       Discovering how much soil life matters was foundational what direction my life went. Seeing a plant comsume 2-3 gallons every single day in water and grow 2-3 inches in 24 hours was enough to get me hooked. Then I started trying some things out in yhe garden. This is where I learnt the most because mother nature often has her own mind. 
       <br>
       I discovered that I can get plants to survive some extreme conditions. I seen dying shrubs come back to life with two root inoculations. I have watched a normally ground laying plant become perkier and pick its self up off the ground and no longer touch it (***rhubarb), all from ***soil microbes and certain ***rotational(nitrogen fixers) practices.

    <h3>
      What I have learnt to date:
    </h3>
      
      <ol>
       <li>
        Nutrients (fertilizers) are below equal to amendments in what they can accomplish. Further is what a certain few  amendments do to plant quality is beyond comprehension, the benifits are numerous and the long term is obvious A. 
       </li>
       <br>
       <li>
         Plants grow much more quickly once life is in the soil.</li>
        <br>
        <li>They are now somehow immune to incredibly windy days.</li> 
        <br>
        <li>They no longer need supports for their heavy fruit like they used too (tomatoes, peppers, rhubarb, raspberries, strawberries, and apple trees to date.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Fruit growth is maximized, something that makes harvest time a true joy to see.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Veganic soil makes plants immune to frosts also. I have had hot pepper plants see a half dozen frosts with soil life and still have up standing leaves, with the actual peppers being firm and eddible still. Then we tried it with tomatoes and same thing. Frost no longer ruins the plant or its fruit like a couple frosts typically do.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Overwatering is not an issue either. We had a month where it rained over 600 mm, which is almost a years worth here and our plants still thrived during and after.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Underwatering is something I know doesn't matter thanks to indoor growing. Fortunately, so far, I have not had to deal with droughts yet.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
         I belive that this type of gardening has potential to offer real problem solving solutions to growers of any kind. </li>
       <br>
       <li>I love veganic <a href="https://gentleworld.org/beginners-guide-to-veganic-gardening/#:~:text=Soil%20conditioners%20and%20fertilizers%20that,as%20comfrey%20or%20nettles)%2C%20and" target=""blank">learning</a>.
