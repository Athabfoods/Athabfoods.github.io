          Sustainable Food Production - What that means to us:
        </h2>
        
    <p>
        Truely sustainable food growth practices are one's that consider all future energy costs that come from the grid. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        From concept, one must take the time to plan how to mitigate all future cost rises. Energy is essential to production. So this is important. Because the price of energy has always shown us increase over the years, and rarely decrease. To cope we must adapt how things are done to curb the longterm impact this has on food costs. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Most importantly,as of yet there are no real solutions being suggested that solve energy. Looking at Ukraine recently shows us this proof. This is why a whole section is included below with well researched alternatives.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Finally, there are countless ideas of what sustainability should look like however, they often fall short and rarely take into account going off grid the as a posibility.

      *** move this section to above project description***
                   
            <p>
        Sources exist on gardening and food production that provide good advice on specific aspects of growing.
        <br>
        However, not many resources exist on how to design a greenhouse that is virtually winter proof while showing why maintaining soil life is an important factor to consider.
