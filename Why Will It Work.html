  <h3>
    How do we know that we can grow Citrus and other warm climate foods here north of Edmonton in Alberta Canada?
  </h3>
        
    Check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Pg3gY7wQ4" target="blank">this guy </a>out near olds Alberta. 
    <br> 
    <br>
    <b>Make sure</b> to see just how warm his greenhouse is shortly after Christmas, in Alberta 2021. This was a very very cold month (and winter) up here. -30 average for most of both December and January. 
  <p>
    
    He manages close to 25C. This is from the Suns energy alone and using a greenhouse cover at night to keep the heat in.
  
  </p>
  
      This is without any sort of special attention to detail like burying the greenhouse into the ground or having the summer heat stored for cold winter usage. 
        <br>
        <br>
      Which is next...
      
<hr>
      
  <p>
    <a href="https://greenhouseinthesnow.com/" target=""blank">Nebraska retire</a> grows <a href="https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/series-media/nebraska-stories-video/season-8-video-15886/greenhouse-in-the-snow-50002014/" target="blank">Oranges in the snow</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AypHj6j6F4s" target=""blank">here</a>.
  </p>
  
    This shows how a simple thermal collection system can stabalize temperatures year round. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This is for less then a dollar a day in power. That is all the energy input he uses. He says 50 cents a day which equals $182.50 per year to heat and cool the entire greenhouse! IMPRESSIVE!
    <br>
    <br>
    And look at the plants he can grow because of it... citrus too...
        <br>
        <br>
    But this greenhouse is still above ground, and his heat is gathered from out in the yard which is outside the greenhouse footprint meaning the winters impact the long term residual heat that can be collected. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In my design we are storing our heat under the greenhouse floor so that over the years the temerature starts to rise up through the dirt and so that it is contained within the foundation walls. 
  <p>
      See Drake Landing below to show why this is important.

    Drake labding is over 10 years old now. The original papers I read on this are not linked above. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Those papers said so many good things about this system, none of which are mentioned here. Since I can not quote them, all I can say is that these people save money this way.
  <p>
      What matters most is the fact that the hest builds over time in the ground and over the decade plus has reached substantial amounts. 
  </p>
      This only proves that over time, the heat gained will grow. That means that as time goes on, heating the greenhouse throughout the winter will only get easier as the temperature rises slowly.

  <p>
    Ultimately what is going to make our success is based upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LFvL_iYVaY" target="blank"> sybiotic relationships between plants</a>. These relationships are what I mean by living soil food web. It is a web of complicated interactions that go beyond the roots as well.
  </p>

    Plus my own lesons and experimention over the years plus alongside my 15+ years as a green thumb, 10 years as a medicinal cannabis producer, the last 8 years gardening, and the last 3 or 4 trying what I learnt in cannabis outdoors with incredible success.

  <h3>
    My motivation:
  </h3>
                   
    <p>
      Sources exist on gardening and food production that provide good advice on specific aspects of growing.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, not many resources exist on how to design a greenhouse that is virtually winter proof while showing why maintaining soil life is an important factor to consider.

    Things I would do to further optimize growth and quality:
  </h3>
        
    <ol>
      <li>What is <a href="https://www.almanac.com/companion-planting-guide-vegetables" target="blank">companion planting</a> exactly? </li>
        <br>
        <br>
      <li>Witnessing some of the magic found in the symbiotic relationship of companion planting is jaw dropping to be sure.</li>
      <br>
      Things companion planting does:
          <ul>
            <li>Repelling pests on nearby plants that normally attract them</li> 
            <li>promoting taste enhancements to neighboring plants</li>
            <li>taste enhancements</li>
            <li>other things I have yet to test</li>
          </ul>
       <br>
       
      <li>Is it important to provide the full spectrum of the sun including <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304423818300967" target="blank">UVA and UVB?</a> (explained in full later on) see <a href="./Plant Plant Care and Soil Life.html"> Plant care</a></li>

  <h3>
    The garden system:
  </h3>
  
    We figure we can grow many varieties of foods up north just as easy as we can down south outside. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Sure it is inside, but there has to be a point where cost of logistics and reducing climate impact matters more than how things are done and the set up costs associated with that.
      <br>
      <br>
    When one considers the impact soil science has on the outcome of plants (described later in the living soil section and why it will work section) they are faced with the possibility that changing food production positively for all people is not only possible its easily achievable.

  <h3>
    Greenhouse concepts - deeper dive into the minutia of our first priject:
  </h3>
  
  <h3>
    General:
  </h3>
  
    First project is a simple greenhouse at first glance. But it is not so simple at all.
      <br>
      <br>
    It will capture all daytime heat and store it underground in the floor of the greenhouse for redistribution when it is winter and especially through the nights.
    
<hr>
  
  <h3>
    Energy. To grid or not to grid:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    We plan to have multiple sources of renewable energy production on site. 
      <br>
      <br>
    Thermo-photo voltaic cells need sun and the sun isn't always shining so we decided on a combo with mini wind as well as a potential to utilize hydrogen fuel cells, at first. 
      <br>
      <br>
    With energy storage. Perhaps the power wall or redox-flow batteries. Or a combination of both for those particularly long winter nights up here.
      <br>
      <br>
    Energy has to be made on site to prevent impacting food costs any further. 
      <br>
      <br>
    Especially since energy costs always goes up, not down. If current long term trends hold true, then it would not be good to neglect energy consumption mitigation. 
  </p>
  
<hr>
  
  <h3>
    Glazing and structure:
  </h3>
  
    To benifit from natural ground warmth, the green house will be in the ground on the north side.
      <br>
      <br>
    Because the glazing target is for EFTE this will replace what is typically lexan or glass, at significantly less weight to hold up this adds useful load that can be supported with the structure. This will benifit us nicely as we can create verticall planting systems off of the roof supports. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This will greatly increase our food output.
      <br>
      <br>
    Since this is an in ground greenhouse, when going from south to north inside will be tiered uphill. This is to allow sun penetration through the rows of trees and to clear the leaves creating equal lighting throughout the tree canopies while maximizing food production space. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Tomatoes are in the ground and above them are rows upon rows of strawberries in auto vertical rotation planters.
      <br>
      <br>
    To further create more layers of food production, the rows of trees will all have rows of dwarf mangos, other dwarf varieties, and smaller plants plated in between the trees for the rows running east to west.
    
  <p>
    
    Water will be collected on the land and stored in outdoor dugouts on property. The rolling hills have plenty of run off that can easily be colllected in a water supply system, outlined later on.
    
  </p>

  <h3>
    Earth:
  </h3>
  
  
    Nature is beautiful, didn't you know? All her sounds, birds chirping and skwaking, bees polinating while they are buzzing around in the air, and the air itself making noises as it russles the leaves on its way by. It is no wonder some say that "Earth is a living planet". 
      <br>
      <br>
    It literally is, one just has to observe it and see life is everywhere around them. 
      <br>
      <br>
    Did you know that for as much life as there is above ground, many factors more exist below our feet in the ground? 
      <br>
      <br>
    Did you know we can sequester oodles of CO2 into the soil by simply growing plants?
    If not then now you do :)

<hr>      
      
  <h3>
    Living soil:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Did I say living soil? I sure did. In fact the soil is teeming with life. Some say that soil is so diverse in microbes that for every tablespoon there is billions of individual living somethings there. 
      <br>
      <br>
    And all those somethings must do something right?
      <br>
      <br>
    ... to be honest, were still working on it. We can say with certainty that having soil life can greatly impact plants positively just as much as we can say that not having life in the soil can be not good for plants.
      <br>
      <br>
    How good / not so good? That is complicated. 
    <br>
    <br>
    You see I have been discovering that it is not entirely the soil life that impacts how, and what, plants contribute to their environment. 
      <br>
      <br>
    With certainty I can say that no soil life means a plant is more or less defenseless. 
    <br>
    <br>
    However, what I do not understand is why adding certain amendments (soil ingredients) do the good things they do to both the plants and their roots.
      <br>
      <br>
    We will go deeper into this later. For now just know that all evidence thus far suggests that we can prevent plant most issues such as pests, fungus and the likes, as well as root issues and we can do it very easily with ***myco inoculations and soil life diversification.
    <br>
    <br>
    You see each of those little guys I mentioned above do special things. When they digest soil contents they do so based on communications from the plants themselves. They can also relay messages back to the plant through the ***mycelium network. Such intredting stuff to share here. Must see data about roots included in link below.
  </p>
  
<hr>
  
  <h3>
    Plants:
  </h3>
  Yes! you read that right. There are communications happening from the plants through the roots to the microbes and back. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The plants send ***exudates which can signal anything from "I am sick and need such and such", to "I am deficient in this nutrient please send it", to "I have a pest infection send ______ to help me flush it out". Some plants even know when their own seed is present. When this happens they can kill off an area of their own roots in order to allow the seed best chances of survival.
      <br>
      <br>
    Plants ***have memory and can react (like ***venus fly trap) to events in their environment.
    
<hr>
  
      
  <h3>
    About microbes:
  </h3>
  
 
    As I said, very intresting things start happening to plants when certain amendments are incorporated into the grow medium. Some seem to make it so the roots can ***fix nitrogen better while others allow water to slowly absorb and distribute equally without running through quickly when the soil is parched.
    <br>
    <br>
    A super useful thing is that most plants become cold resilient to the point of still being edible after half a dozen frosts (5-6). 
      <br>
      <br>
    They are able to take on more water than normal also but somehow not become over watered no matter how much you water them.  <b>Without rood damage or stunted growth</b> plants are better able to protect themseves. They can also handle droughts just as well meaning watering is less necessary when tha happens, saving costs. 
      <br>
      <br>
    They can somehow pick themselves up off the ground. In other words a plant that normally lay on the dirt, that you normally have to watch for food rot because of this no longer stay on the ground and thus saves on wasted food. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Instead they literally grow upright! Firmly! 
    <br>
    <br>
    They are also extremely wind resistant. As in, we had a week of super winds that were well over 100km/hr+++ for a few days (our weather station only registers that high), our garden was fine for the most part. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Other plants, outside the garden, were not so lucky. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Trees had many down leaves and branches... worse in some cases.
    
  <p>
  What ever it is that comes to life in the soil certainly helps plants in many ways.
  <br>
  <br>
  I now know it does things that are almost to good to be true because year after year I have seen the same sorts of results...
