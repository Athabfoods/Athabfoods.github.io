    How do we know that we can grow Citrus and other warm climate foods here north of Edmonton in Alberta Canada?
  </h3>
        
    Check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Pg3gY7wQ4" target="blank">this guy </a>out near olds Alberta. 
    <br> 
    <br>
    <b>Make sure</b> to see just how warm his greenhouse is shortly after Christmas, in Alberta 2021. This was a very very cold month (and winter) up here. -30 average for most of both December and January. 
  <p>
    
    He manages close to 25C. This is from the Suns energy alone and using a greenhouse cover at night to keep the heat in.
  
  </p>
  
      This is without any sort of special attention to detail like burying the greenhouse into the ground or having the summer heat stored for cold winter usage. 
        <br>
        <br>
      Which is next...

  <p>
    <a href="https://greenhouseinthesnow.com/" target=""blank">Nebraska retire</a> grows <a href="https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/series-media/nebraska-stories-video/season-8-video-15886/greenhouse-in-the-snow-50002014/" target="blank">Oranges in the snow</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AypHj6j6F4s" target=""blank">here</a>.
  </p>
  
    This shows how a simple thermal collection system can stabalize temperatures year round. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This is for less then a dollar a day in power. That is all the energy input he uses. He says 50 cents a day which equals $182.50 per year to heat and cool the entire greenhouse! IMPRESSIVE!
    <br>
    <br>
    And look at the plants he can grow because of it... citrus too...
        <br>
        <br>
    But this greenhouse is still above ground, and his heat is gathered from out in the yard which is outside the greenhouse footprint meaning the winters impact the long term residual heat that can be collected. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In my design we are storing our heat under the greenhouse floor so that over the years the temerature starts to rise up through the dirt and so that it is contained within the foundation walls. 
  <p>
      See Drake Landing below to show why this is important.

    Why show this place?
        <br>
        <br>
    Because it proves that Edmonton can not only grow various southern plant varieties this far north under glass, we have been doing it for over 30 years...

    Drake labding is over 10 years old now. The original papers I read on this are not linked above. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Those papers said so many good things about this system, none of which are mentioned here. Since I can not quote them, all I can say is that these people save money this way.
  <p>
      What matters most is the fact that the hest builds over time in the ground and over the decade plus has reached substantial amounts. 
  </p>
      This only proves that over time, the heat gained will grow. That means that as time goes on, heating the greenhouse throughout the winter will only get easier as the temperature rises slowly.

    Plus my own lesons and experimention over the years plus alongside my 15+ years as a green thumb, 10 years as a medicinal cannabis producer, the last 8 years gardening, and the last 3 or 4 trying what I learnt in cannabis outdoors with incredible success.

  <h3>
    My motivation:
  </h3>
                   
    <p>
      Sources exist on gardening and food production that provide good advice on specific aspects of growing.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, not many resources exist on how to design a greenhouse that is virtually winter proof while showing why maintaining soil life is an important factor to consider.

    Things I would do to further optimize growth and quality further:
  </h3>
        
    <ol>
      <li>What is <a href="https://www.almanac.com/companion-planting-guide-vegetables" target="blank">companion planting</a> exactly? </li>
        <br>
        <br>
      <li>Witnessing some of the magic found in the symbiotic relationship of companion planting is jaw dropping to be sure.</li>
      <br>
      Things companion planting does:
          <ul>
            <li>Repelling pests on nearby plants that normally attract them</li> 
            <li>promoting taste enhancements to neighboring plants</li>
            <li>taste enhancements</li>
            <li>other things I have yet to test</li>
          </ul>
       <br>
       
      <li>Is it important to provide the full spectrum of the sun including <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304423818300967" target="blank">UVA and UVB?</a> (explained in full later on)</li> 
      <li>More to come...</li>
    
    </ol>
