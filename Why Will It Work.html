        Check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Pg3gY7wQ4" target=""blank"> this guy </a> out near olds Alberta. <br> <b>Make sure</b> you see just how warm he has his greenhouse shortly after Christmas in Alberta in 2021, which was a very very cold month and winter up here. (Think -30 average for the whole of December) Yet he manages over 20C from the Suns energy alone, and a blanket at night.
