        *** re edit this section***
        <p>
        The reality is that doing things the way we did for so long was simply because there was no other way to do so.That is now in the past and we find ourselves in an era where technology and creative processes can actually impact how things are done significantly. 
        <p>
          
        </p>We stand on the edge of a two way choice, keep up how we do things and stay tied to a life time of careers, inflation and potential for failire or do we allow the future in to help make our lives easier? 
        <br>Do you want to be one to benifit from the freedom that technology can provide for agriculture? <a href="https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p0bkdc02/the-first-fully-automated-farms" target=""blank">Automated Farms</a>.
