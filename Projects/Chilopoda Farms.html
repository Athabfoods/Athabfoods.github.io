  <h3>Project 3 - Chilopoda Farms (Closed-loop food facility)</h3>
  
  Chilopoda Farms food facility. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Major R and D project needing multiple professions and trades. We are combining several different processes together to produce food in a closed-loop facilty. 
  <br>
  <br>
  This is also a franchise type implementation and ownership structure as C&C Farms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of this is able to work with projects #1 and #2. However this project needs C&C Farms to supply chickens and chicken feed. Once fine tuned they can be put into an old warehouse, mall, an unused store front or  high-rise to utilize unused buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  All food sources closer to the mouths they feed are cheaper and this is an in city design, as close as one can get to the mouths it feeds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Planned eliverable are broilers (meat chickens) and laying hens, a few species fish, various plants, 3 types of compost, two animal feeds, AND its own energy that is fueled from <!--***-->bio digestion (german garbage trucks) producing methane or ethane gas that is then used to fuel a cogeneration plant.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <a href="./Cogeneration.html">Cogeneration</a> provides heating and cooling, CO2 to <!--***-->boost plant growth, and electricity. The energy produced is 90+% efficient thanks to ***Cummins Cogeneration technology.
  <br>
  <br>
    Any extra energy will be given to the grid for free or for minimal costs.
    
  <p>
    Closed-loop means that nothing will be coming into the facility at all. 
    <br>
    <br>
    My research is based upon literature that shows smaller stages of this design working very well.
    </p>
  
    Wastes are mitigated by composting, by feeding other products, and by bio-digestion to fuel power genration.
