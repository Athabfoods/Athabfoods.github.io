  <h3>Project 2 - C&C Farms (Cows and /Chickens Farm)(Turn-key)</h3>

  Creates an important feed stream for Chilopoda Farms facility (project 3). 
  <br>
  <br>
  This step complements the greenhouse by showing viability of future projects. 
  <br>
  <br>
  This is called C&C Farms. It is a turn-key type operation that uses automated milking and egg collection systems as well as automated storage, automated logistic dispatching and automated paddock rotation. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We run ot for a few years to work out the kinks balancing heard and flock size to the food growing capacity of the land for a given number of acres. 
  <br>
  <br>
    This research phase will allow us to pay off the equipment and farm and then pay for two more locations. R & D phase  is to fine tune the systems with the land and animals compared to customer needs.
  <br>
  <br>
  This gives our customers a well oiled, already funtioning, established business so that they can become farmer with minimal training in a turn key sort of set up. Giveing comfort to clients who want to invest in farming but aren't sure because ________. This way they will know they have a solid business to take responsibility of and not stumble.
  <br>
  <br>.  
  Milk and eggs are collected in bulk in the outlying areas, they are brought to a pasteurizer and packaging facility it the city then products are shiped to local retailer.
    <br>
    <br>
    We hope to produce most milk locally this way, within 100 - 200 km from urban populations. The intent is to reduce costs by removing some of the long distance logistics costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since this design (C&C Farms) is ballanced with Chilopoda Farms, input costs are significantly reduced because feed is grown around the paddocks and cow manure clean up is taken care of by the chickens. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Apperently <!--***-->methane is significantly reduced by feeding cows a certain type of seaweed supliment. This is one thing that can be grown in the next project facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  Water is from any of, or all of the following; drilled well, river source, land and roof collcted and stored, or city water. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Heat is from electricity and supply same as the greenhouse, on site or close by.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first farm pays for the next two farms. When that is done we give away the first one like a habitat for humanity house. The next two are now paid for in full so we run those two until they pay for two more each = four. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Every location pays for two more.
  <br>
  <br>
  We give 70% of shares to the client and keep a portion so we can keep relationship between C&C Farms and Chilopoda Farms going indefinitely.
  <br>
  <br>
   Now #2 and #3 are released keeping 4,5,6 and 7. When they pay for two more each = 8, we give the previous 4 away. The 8 pay for 16 we give 8 away. 16 pays for 32, we give 16 away. 32 pays for 64 we give away 32. 64 builds 128 then 256, 512, 1024 and so on and so forth until there are no cities up north long distance shipping milk.
  <br>
  <br>
  We brand all containers the same no matter the location so people know by the brand name that it is all sourced locally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Side note:
  <br>
  Jersey cows (milk cows) produce <!--***-->30 liters a day max. This means that 50 cows produce about 1500 liters a day max. Which is about 547,000 liters a year. Even with typical loses or shortages we stand to sell minimum 350,000 liters per quarter section or section.
  <br>
  <br>
  R and D is required to make the milk and egg collection buildings modular. If things don't work out in a particular area we simply remove the facility and truck it to a new location. It is also to figure out how many cows can be supprted on x# of acres and how many <!--***-->chickens it takes to keep the cow manure spread out and not damage the. land
