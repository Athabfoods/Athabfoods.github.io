      <h3> 
        10 Major problems that cost you more:
      </h3>
        
        <p>
        1.We ***pay for our ***food and it is worse the further*** north one goes(showing crazy food prices in remote areas) something that mostly ***grows for free (show fields and sun). A big part of that cost is influenced by long distance shipping and all that that takes to accomplish. While traveling this huge distance, about 25% goes bad, by the time it gets to Canada, estimates are around ***half of what leaves the farm reaches your store, at which point about half to three quarters is able to be sold before it too goes ***bad. End result is that upwards of 70% of can be lost during this process...
        </p>
        
        <p>
        2.As seen with the picture from point #1 above, it is very complicated, which adds to the purchase cost at the store. This is because of all of the logistics involved.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        3.To account for shipping time means your food is picked early enough to be <a href="https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/CAN/Year/LTST/TradeFlow/Import/Partner/by-country/Product/16-24_FoodProd" target=""blank"> shipped</a>, sit at a warehouse, be shipped again, then sit at the grocery store waiting for you to pick it up. This does two things, one, you get something that is not very fresh when picked and thus it does not taste as good as it could and two, it has traveled upwards of 15,000 km or more and much of it along the way has <a href="https://www.rcinet.ca/en/2021/03/06/new-report-provides-numbers-on-how-much-food-is-wasted-in-canada/" target=""blank"> rotted and been tossed </a>.
       <br>
        Also, ships use huge <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4uMX5mWAF4" target=""blank">engines</a>, burning large amounts of fuel. (Mega Diesel Engine | Exceptional Engineering | Free Documentary)
        </p>
        
        <p>
        4.Most Greenhouses are poorly designed <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Ffigure%2FEvaporative-cooling-boxes-in-greenhouse_fig2_277674004&psig=AOvVaw29u3IS96FRNGPxTiwE2t9f&ust=1689276713499000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=2ahUKEwi5tOCk9ImAAxWIIjQIHed7D9QQr4kDegUIARDWAQ" target=""blank"> cooling </a> and <a href="https://www.bridgegreenhouses.co.uk/renewable/" target=""blank"> heating </a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        5.<a href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!ApjedxVRObvUfhV8GxX7mQSFm80?e=pVAzRD" target=""blank"> Costs </a> to heat and cool greenhouses are enormous. 
        <br>(see pages 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 of 2019 Alberta Greenhouse Crops report on costs by the Alberta Government)
        </p>
        
        <p>
        6.Pesticides, Fertilizers, etc.
        <br>
        (please see the same pages above, page #s 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 from last link from number 6).
        </p> 
        
        <p>Looking closer you can see, growing medium costs, fertilizers, chemicals and energy costs are by far the most in every report. Mitigating these huge costs are easy with the right design of greenhouse.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        7.Monoculture is a practice that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8838759/" target=""blank"> depletes soil </a> life over time, this is why our farming practices are struggling now.
        </p> 
        
        <p>
        8.The impact on environment with certain fertilizers and wastes accumulate over the ***years(bluegreen algae). Some are toxic like pest ***controls (glyphosate), others wastes are ***compostable (how to compost) and can be sold.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        9.Energy is <a href="https://energyregulationquarterly.ca/articles/a-historical-and-comparative-perspective-on-ontarios-electricity-rates#sthash.ci2gqjDA.JhTXLMUg.dpbs" target=""blank"> ever increasing </a> in cost, which means  that as time goes on, food becomes increasingly more expensive regardless of any other efficencies, energy is an ever ominous shadow that threatens long term feasibility of any design that does not mitigate their uses at least by 95%.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        10.If <a href="https://greenhouseinthesnow.com/" target=""blank"> food can be produced </a> further north in unlickly climates, just imagine what can be done for many people globally.
