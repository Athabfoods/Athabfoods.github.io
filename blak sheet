  Since I am more than sure it <i>is</i> the soil that does all that, my next garden (which will be after I'm done school)  I will continue my quest for better food growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  One day I'm sitting around reading an article about coming food shortages not believing them. Then COVID hit and I seen the store shelves, that was when it all hit me like a ton of bricks... the impact that <i>this can have on our food system</i> and on relieving hunger in general is immense. Food produced at home in this mannor can bring many varieties of plant growth into regions of yearly coldness. 
  <br>
  <br>
    Due to the controversy surrounding some topics surrounding our food system like glyphosate (roundup) and those lawsuits, as well as with regards to food waste, among others.
    <br>
    <br>
    For this reason I chose to provide data in a way that is refrence based and from many others successes and sources. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Refrences can speak for my leaned experience because what I have learnt is so incredible to plant growth and plant resilience that it needs many mouths saying it for anyone to take seriously. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Also, if it wasn't for others free resources none of this would be possible and so without further adieu

    Below are examples of year round plant growth that are acheived locally, right here in ***Edmonton Alberta. I add onto these succeses with other improvements and design tweaks that I have yet to test. Instead I provide the data to support my ideas while illustrating how they will help the over all success of a well designed food production system tha is ***sustainable as the deffintion would define it.
