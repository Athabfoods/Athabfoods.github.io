            Project vision:
        </h3>
        
    <p>
        To create a greenhouse system that allows for the growth of foods grown in warmer climates, foods typically grown tropically, subtropically, or temperate grown, and bring them into regions where these foods could never be grown. Like Edmonton, Alberta.

          <li>-Use solar <a href="https://dualsun.com/en/products/dualsun-spring/" target="blank">thermal energy</a> storage to create a year round equal growing climate.</li>
          <br>
          <li>-Use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYunPJQWZ1o" target="blank">mothernature</a> (see <a href="https://www.nature.com/" target="blank">
Nature magazine</a>) as a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/episodes" target="blank">teacher (David Suzuki- Nature of Things)</a>. 
<br>
<br>
Soil life <a href="https://www.growweedeasy.com/super-soil-vs-coco-coir-side-by-side-cannabis-grow-journal" target="blank">matters</a>, and so we try to replicate what she does in the wild into each and every garden pot we mix we make.</li>
          <br>
          <br>
    <li>-Utilize glazing products (glass) that promote more of the <a href="https://ceresgs.com/an-introduction-to-etfe-glazing-for-greenhouses/" target="blank">suns rays</a> to penetrate. 
    <br>Being immensely <a href="https://www.makmax.com/dcms_media/image/13_ETFE_film.pdf" target="blank">lighter</a> than glass and quite a bit lighter than various kinds of plastics (see ceres link), <a href="https://www.agcchem.com/products/etfe-and-greenhouse-films/" target="blank">ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE)</a> is by far one of the more superior choices for <a href="https://www.edenproject.com/" target="blank">glazing a greenhouse</a>. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This is due to its <a href="https://www.boedeker.com/Product/ETFE#:~:text=General%20Info,with%20thermal%20and%20chemical%20resistance." target="blank">properties</a> as a greenhouse covering. It is an <a href="https://omnexus.specialchem.com/selection-guide/ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene-etfe-plastic" target="blank">ultra light, self cleaning, able to be layered for insulating against the cold, as well as letting 99% of the suns ray spectrum in</a>. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Plants are used to being outside and grow the best outside because of the suns rays. Pests that are an issue in greenhouses are an issue partly because of the fact that other glazings can block <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2019.01563/full#:~:text=UVA%20Increases%20Biomass%20Production%2C%20But,highly%20correlated%20with%20growth%20conditions." target="blank">UVA</a>,

        <li>Since we will be able to sell at a much lower rate than what it costs to plant, grow, be picked, get ***trucked, be ***stored, then ***shipped 10,000km, ***stored again in ***seacans in a ***shipyard, then ***trucked again to a ***warehouse,  from the warehouse - trucked again to your ***grocery shelves. That is alot of steps to the local store.</li>

    <br>

  <h2>
    Greenhouse design benifits:
  </h2>
    <p>
    With automated watering all you would have left to do is ***seed(easy seeder) and ***pick(easy microgreens picker), weed and that's practically it! 
    Rarely having to worry about pests and even rarer to fertilize. 
    </p>
    
    Food grown like this would be positively impactful to many people.
    
    <p>
      Grown in a self heating, self cooling greenhouse with hvac power supplied renewably. 
    <br>
    <br>
      It never needs a furnace or cooling, and grows as well as if your fertilizing and watering sufficiently. Tastes fresher and better than average.
    </p>
        
  
      Olds college shows how plants can be used to filter nasty water. See <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2080084547527" target="blank">college</a> shows excellent proof of <a href="https://www.oldscollege.ca/smart-farm-research/research-projects/livestock/current/floating-island-technology-for-livestock-water-remediation.html" target="blank">plants filtering water</a>.

  <h3>
    Social Impact:
  <h3>

    
    <p>We hope to highlight the ability to grow all desirable foods localy. We hope to stimulate a new business sector with great economic potential. 
    </p>
    
 
    If these greenhouses were spread about we could bring food production (*that is cost reduced immerserably) into ***neighborhoods(show arizona man with his street) that need it. Imagine the positive impact that would have over the years.

  <h3>
    Crime prevention:
  </h3>
    
    <p>
    I am a firm believer that people commit crime for a few reasons, one, they need money to live and be sheltered. Two, they need food to eat, and three, they need to continue on doing what they have to because of their life situation - addiction. 
    Since addiction can easily be cured (see kratom and ayahuasca area - under construction). What is left is hunger and needing to live and be housed. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      By creating food systems that impact society with incredible cost savings we have the potential to reduce crime significantly (if done correctly), by reducing the need to fulfill those basic needs crime to fulfill them will disapear altogether.
      
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Simply spreading 50 or 100 sites accross a city each at 50 feet wide by 100 to 200 feet long can create between 250,000 and 500,000 square feet of growing space (not accounting for the verticle aspect or soil or companion planting). That is alot of food
