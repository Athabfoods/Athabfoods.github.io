  <h3> 
    Municipal governments, our streets and hunger:
  </h3>
    
    
    Think about this. If cities had planted food in their boulevards, like berry and fruit bushes, instead of the trees they did, and they did so for one out of every 10 trees... today there would be hundreds of thousands, probably millions of food producing trees and shrubs spread accross countless streets in cities, towns, villages, and urban areas...
    <br>
    <br>
    What then? 
    <br>
    <br>
    Don't you think that some, if not many of the millions of hungry people would be less hungry?
    <br>
    <br>
    Fact is that the money was spent buying those trees anyways... so why not have spent it on food plants that can feed citizens?!?
