            Overall Company Goals and Objectives:
        </h2> 
        
        <p>
         -To bring warm climate food growth out of the south and into regions that are normally thought of as seasonal only.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         -To create multiple food systems that feed people in many different situations according to location. 
         <br>
         Whether you are in the country, the city, an old warehouse, or remotely located these systems provide food with very minimal:
         <ul>
             <li>Costs from grid inputs like gas and electricity</li> 
             <li>Costs to dispose of wastes that can not be recycled</li>
             <li>Cost loss due to deficencies during plant growth</li>
         </ul>
         </p>
         
     <p>
         These systems work together to provide comprehensive food growth of many varieties within many regions internationally. I am not just trying to grow the hard to grow citrus and produce like listed above, but also provide ways to raise eggs, milk, chickens, fish, and a mix of other plant products such as spices and unique root veggies are all no longer dependant on grow location. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
         -To integrate already standard production practicies together with technology and data to increase production, reduce chemical usage, reduce or eliminate wastes, and use nature as an example in order to promote plant health, vitality and growth longevity.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         -Show how easy it is to revive soils with simple practicies as well as to show the progression of life revitalization in soil with microscope pictures and video.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         -Utilize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LFvL_iYVaY" target=""blank"> sybiotic relationships  </a> between plants to provide nutrients from soil food web microbes to improve plant production and produce quality without adding fertilizers, pesticides, herbacides or any chemicals at all. (Link is to Nature of Things Video with David Suzuki about roots of forest plants and how they talk to each other and share resources.)
         </p>
         
         <p>
         -Take what we learn with the first two aspects of this food system to show the potential of the other, much larger research and development system which is a way to produce food completly off grid with no feedstocks, no energy input at all from any grid source at all.
