       <h2>
            Overall Company Goals and Objectives:
        </h2> 
        
        <p>
         -To bring warm climate food growth out of the south and into regions that are normally thought of as seasonal only.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         -To create multiple food systems that feed people in many different situations according to location. 
         <br>
         Whether you are in the country, the city, an old warehouse, or remotely located these systems provide food with very minimal:
         <ul>
             <li>Costs from grid inputs like gas and electricity</li> 
             <li>Costs to dispose of wastes that can not be recycled</li>
             <li>Cost loss due to deficencies during plant growth</li>
         </ul>
         </p>
         
     <p>
         These systems can work together to provide comprehensive food growth of many varieties within many regions internationally. I am not just trying to grow the hard to grow citrus and produce but also provide ways to raise eggs, milk, chickens, fish, and a mix of other plant products such as spices and unique root veggies. Thanks too various design and technology advancementswe can grow foods from warmer regions in significantly cooler ones. We can do things like grow citrus in regions where it snows once a year. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
         We aim to integrate already standard production practicies together with technology and data to increase production rates, reduce chemical usage, reduce or eliminate wastes output, create a closed loop food production model, integrate power geneation and storage to remove electrical costs altogether, utilize automation to make delivery to doorstep a future probability, reduce overhead with data and automation, +.
        </p>
         
         <p>
         -Show how easy it is to revive lifeless soils with simple practicies as well.
         </p>
         
         <p>Show the progression of life revitalization in soil with microscope, pictures and video.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         -Utilize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LFvL_iYVaY" target=""blank"> sybiotic relationships  </a> between plants to provide nutrients from soil food web via microbes to improve plant production and produce quality without adding fertilizers, pesticides, herbacides or any chemicals at all. (Link shows evidence of root interactions in canadian forests that are outside of what was thought a few years ago).
