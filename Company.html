            Overall Company Goals and Objectives:
        </h2> 
        
        <p>
         -To bring warm climate food growth out of the south and into regions that are normally thought of as seasonal only.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         -To create multiple food systems that feed people in many different situations according to location. 
         <br>
         Whether you are in the country, the city, an old warehouse, or remotely located these systems provide food with very minimal:
         <ul>
             <li>Costs from grid inputs like gas and electricity</li> 
             <li>Costs to dispose of wastes that can not be recycled</li>
             <li>Cost loss due to deficencies during plant growth</li>
         </ul>
         </p>
         
     <p>
         These systems can work together to provide comprehensive food growth of many varieties within many regions internationally. 
         <br>
         I am not just trying to grow the hard to grow citrus and produce but to also provide enough resources so individuals, groups, families, co-ops, or start-up businesses, can get into producing foods for themselves or to sell. 
         <br>
         Our goal is to show how easy it is to grow plants certain ways. We also intend to describe other processes that allow for other popular food items to be sustainably provided. 
         <ul>
           <li>eggs,</li> 
           <li>milk,</li> 
           <li>chickens,</li> 
           <li>fish,</li> 
           <li>spices,</li>
           <li>foreign and specialty,</li>
           <li>as well as a diverse number of other plants</li>. 
           </ul>
           
        <p>
             This is ***thanks too various ***design and ***technology advancements ***out there. We can now grow foods from warmer regions in ***significantly cooler ones and we can do so with impressive results.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I know from personal experience that we can grow citrus like ***Kumquats, ***Key ***Limes, and Lemon (***Mayer or ***Eureka, can not remember) 
         </p>
         
         <p>
         We aim to integrate already standard production practicies together with technology and data to increase production rates, reduce chemical usage, reduce or eliminate wastes output, create a closed loop food production model, integrate power geneation and storage to remove electrical costs altogether, utilize automation to make delivery to doorstep a future probability, reduce overhead with data and automation, +.
        </p>
         
         <p>
         -Show how easy it is to revive lifeless soils with simple practicies as well.
         </p>
         
         <p>Show the progression of life revitalization in soils that need it through microscope, picture, video, and slides.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         Ultimately what is going on to make our success is based upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LFvL_iYVaY" target=""blank"> sybiotic relationships between plants</a> to provide nutrients from the ***soil food web via ***microbes to improve plant production and produce quality without pests. This removes the continued costs of buying fertilizers, pesticides, herbacides or any other chemicals at all because they are simply not needed.
