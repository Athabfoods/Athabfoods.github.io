    <br>
    They claim that we have made mistakes in our fields. We certainly <!--***-->hear about it today more then ever before, but is that true? Are we really at a state of no return in agriculture, or is that just another reason to charge us more money?
  <p>
    It is incredibly difficult to tell because their words are usually <!--***-->ominous sounding and in some ways believable.

    Journey:

    On my journey of food learning I have often found that the knowledge required to grow <!--***-->veganically (pure <!--***-->vegan organics) was spread accross many websites and information types.
    <br>
    <br>
    I have siffted through oodles to accomplish what I have thus far in my garden. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Forests are phenomenal growth machines where plants seem to be resistant to the various issues that are found in a typical urban garden.
    <br>
    <br>
    Most of what is found on this webisite pertans to plant growth specifically, and how we can have <!--***-->food systems work together in order to reduce costs significantly.
    <p>
    More importantly, I suggest why our system is flawed, showing ways that others have used to <!--***curtis farms-->alleviate their own costs.

  <h3>
    What can plants do that is so important to share?:
  </h3>

  Growing plants is not only thrilling. It is rewarding on many levels.
  
  <p>

  Like when you defeat a few frosts and end up with edible food still. Or when the garden survives a wind storm but the rest of the yard doesn't... at all.
  
  </p>
  
  You can't help but wonder how much of it <i>is</i> from the changes you made, or if it's all in your head. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Then you remember that the last time there was a flood and you lost a bunch, or almost everything in one case. And that you have lost plants (and food) every single time something extreme happens. 
  
  <p>

  Then a miracle happens again, but this time you get waaay better results because you decided to push it, just to see, you know? 

  </p>
  
  Whoa!!! Not only are your plants alive, I'm thinking these are zombie plants because of how many frosts they have been through. Yet somehow these potted green beauties are green leafed, supple and alive enough while the rest of the garden is frozen stiff to the point that touching any part breaks it. This is typical with a frozen plant.
  <br>
  <br>
  But these frozen plants are right beside my 'special pots', with the amendments and the sciency stuff I did to them, with soil life I think is there but have no proof that <i>it is</i> actually <i>in there</i> even though for the third year in a row plants are doing things that plants don't normally do. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Flora (plants) don't normally survive certain conditions in normal field soil as mentioned. Most plants (flora) also can't really handle torrential down pours, but these amended ones do. 
  <p>
    Plants that don't freeze and are still movable as if not frozen (their leaves and stems) is unheard of at -5C after a night that was colder. But its happened. Twice now.
  </p>
  
    The second time they survived several frosts in a row because they were planted in pots of living soil as opposed to normal soil... what ever that means, right? 

  <p>
    All the aformentioned things that happened becasue I amended the soil and then revitalized its life. 
    <br>
    In other words,by simply promoting life, and adding certain other ingredients into the soil I was able to acheive those incredible things in my gardens, in my pots and while growing anything indoors. 
    </p>
    Now iagine if we took the soil improvements and the incredible that does then also did the following?:
  
  <ul>
    <li>Building design enhancments</li>
    <li>Special greenhouse technologies</li>
    <li>Automation</li>
    <li>Companion planting</li>
    <li>Symbiotic planing</li>
    <li>Consideration for what a plant provides to the soil in its life (rotational croping)</li>
    <li>Thermal battery (heat storage)</li>
    <li>Water oxygenation</li>
    <li>On site energy production and storage</li>
  </ul>
  To name a few improvements.
  
    Above, aside from building designs and energy production, I have tried then tested them and I confirm they work individually and combined. Then I tested the soils alongside some or many of those ideas. This is why I feel that the more we combine the better the outcome will be.
  <p>
    What I have not tried yet is growing indoors with automation in any of the buildings outlined so I have yet been able to combine those ideas with all the sciency soil and plant stuff.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Plants needs and how that relates:
  </h3>
  
    We all know that when a plant grows it needs some basic ingredients, right?
      <ul>
        <li>Things like ;energy - from the sun or lights</li>
        <li>Food - through the root system</li>
        <li>Water - from various sources</li>
        and
        <li>CO2 - From the air (what we exhale)</li>
      </ul>
      
  <p>
   That's it right?
  </p>
  
  Actually no. Plants need the above things, these items below are certainly 'extras' in a way. That said, they do some amazing things when applied to plants, especially food, mmmmm umm!


<h3>
  What else can a plant need?:
</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mirobes. Some call them 'myco's' or <!-- ***-->'mycohyzzyl' which are fungi (mushroom).</li>
      <li>We need a source of these microbes. Compost tea, humus, compost, store bought inocculant cocktail, micro brew, etc. are all excellent sources of soil life. When we put these things on, or in our soil we say we are 'inoculatibg it'.</li>
      <li>Microbes need to eat something, so at first we need to give them food until they get going. As long as the root zone and soil immediately around the root zone are not disturbed the microbes will take hold. Until then we use sugar (de-sulfurated molasses) water with a humic acid blend and/or more inoculant / brew once a month.</li>
      <li>They need good water and adequate sun light. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Artificial lights work but are really expensive if paying for the equipment and the power bill.</li>
      <li>A person should also monitor the propogation of microbes throughout the soil through a microscope. <!--***-->see microscope section - Coming soon.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      
    Did you know that <!--***-->plants require Oxygen also? 
  </p>
  
  They do. Not much, but they do.
  <br>
  <br>
  In nature, it usually happens when rain falls. As raindrops fall they become concentrated with O2, when a drop hits the ground it takes that trapped oxygen into the ground with it. This oxygenates the roots which helps the roos do their routine better as well asding to the other positive effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Why? Oxygen promotes the roots to help plants process starches and sugars more efficiently. We all know how esential sugars are to photosynthesis. Well photosynthesis has another waste besides Oxygen, it's starch and thus very importat to process well. 
  <br>
  <br>
  A plabt sort of breathes once per day. During the day oxygen is exchanged out the leaves while absorbing carbon dioxide. This happens while the roots take in Oxygen and out put CO2. At night the plant stops most of its oxygen production and the roots turn day time produced starches back into sugars and other things the plant needs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Side note:
  <br>
  Lightning atomizes the air with every strike.
   There are studies that suggest this helps sterilize the water by atomizing the atmosphere around rain as it falls. 
   <br>
<hr>
<hr>

  Growing plants can be easy. Then there is the maintenance and extra costs:
  <ul>
    <li>Fertilizing.</li>
    <li>Occasional pests, moulds, etc.</li>
    <li>Root zone issues with over watering.</li>
    <li>Weather - wind, hail etc.</li>
    <li>Heating and cooling costs or short season.</li>
    <li>Length of season in Northern climates.</li>
    <li>Quality of long distance shipped foods at store.</li>
    <li>Length of time produce is good in your fridge.</li>
    <li>Watering costs, in most cases.</li>
    <li>Too cool at night during the shoulder seasons (Spring and Fall).</li>
    <li>Other minor costs might include tools, pots, watering equipmemt, sprayers, pruners, etc but are typically only one time purchases.</li>
  </ul>
  The actual growing of aplant is done by soil water and sunlight, we do nothing there. We do plant the seeds or seedlings, weed throughout the year and then harvest. The rest, besides watering, should be free.
  <br>
  <br>
  Majority of weeds are mitogated with top dressing. 
  <br>
  <br>Some plants can not tollerate being to wet. 
  <br>
  <br>Be sure to check your variety on the extention site to see if your variety can handle base dressings; whether shredded bark, wood chips, lawn clippings, leaves or whatever, 
  <br>
  *DON'T let any top dressing touch stems of plants or tree trunks. Always keep back 3+ inches and only an inch or two thick.
  <p>
    There are also automated seeders of various types, from <!--***-->handheld to <!--***-->farmer sized. And there also harversters in the same range, <!--***-->hand held to <!--***-->farmer sized.
  </p>
  
  
  So it turns out that growing a plant can be easy but often growing it simply ends up being more work than planned.
  <br>
  <br>
  We can also grow it with many moving parts but in fact, it only sounds that way. It is alot more about knowing what to watch for and reacting ahead of ________ becoming an issue, which is rare.
  <br>
  <br>
  Setting it all up is the hardest part. Once things get going though, it only becomes easier and more efficient the longer conditions are maintained. Which is why I mentioned microscope skills they are required. Thankfully those skills can <!--***-->easily be learnt in this day and age.
  <br>
  <br>
    Last and almsot the most important fact is the type of light a plant gets. Plants grow best under the sun, plain and simple. Indoors or outdoors, it doesn't matter. The best growth rates come from the sun, hands down! 
    <br>
    <br>
    Because HID lights cost a lot and get way to hot indoors to provide less than the same number of <!--***-->lumens the sun can naturaly. Lumens are the amount of light energy (photons) per square foot that hits a plants leaf surface. More lumens equals faster and more robust growth. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Since these lights are crazy expensive both in *<!--***-->LED (for set up costs) the low power option, or in the amount of <!--***-->energy used for the HID option. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Furthermore, bulbs only last so long and must eventually be replaced. Even LEDs. Although LEDs are significantly longer life span they still do have a maximum service life and are many fold more expensive then high pressure sodium or metal halide bulbs.
    <br>
    <br>
    There is a third option for lighting that is excellent for indoor growth, but I am unsure if they still exist or not.
    <br>
    <br>
    This is why the glazing (glass over greehouse) choice is crutial here. 
    <p>
      My choice is <!--***-->FETF, which is described <!--***-->here.
    </p>
    
    Another reason indoor greenhouses costs lots of money to grow is because the growing season is as long as the greenhouse can stay warm from the sun each year, meaning less months per year producing. Reduced output equals cost losses. 
    <br>
    <br>
    We will he growing year round, or darn close to it. I can say that at least 9-10 months of growth per year is achievable, at minimum.
    <br>
    <br>
    Greenhouses could be <!--***-->heated but that costs a heap of money too.
    <br>
    <br>
    We heat our greenhouse with thermal heat. See description below.
    <br>
    <br>
    We may require lighting, if so, those costs are mitigated by on-site energy generation and storage, with energy credits, or by energy production close by (in some cases).
    <br>
    <br>
    Aside from these factors and a few other minor costs shipping is a huge percentage of food costs on store shelves.
    <br>
    <br>
    In reality the only costs that should be added to the price of food <i>really are:</i> 
  <ol>
    <li>Labour needed to:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Plant</li>
      or
      <li>Seed it</li>
      and then
      <li>Harvest it</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Time needed to:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Weed the garden throughout the year</li> 
        <li>Process food at harvest</li>
        and
        <li>Package and store for later sale</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
      Aside from these costs plants do grow for free. 
    <br>
    <br>
    As you can see, the more we try to accomplish in restricted growing areas the more it has costed us traditionally. I have also suggested how each cost can be taken care of. See below and projects for more.
<!--Add link to projects page-->

<hr>

  <h3>
    Initial set up:
  </h3>
    Like with anything, you have to purchase items to start out. Things like soil, pots, watering systems, ventilation, greenhouse structure, etc., all need purchasing anyways. Simply substitute some of the initial items for certain other ones instead and in the long run less is spent.
    <br>
    <br>
    Instead of soil buy <!--***-->pre amended <!--***-->starter soils.
    <br>
    Instead of ventilation, heating and cooling invest in <!--***-->GHAT style greenhouse.
    <br>
    Instead of glass buy <!--***-->FETF.
    <br>
    Instead of pesticides, herbacides and fertilizers buy amendments for every now and then, <!--***-->neem oil or neem cake, <!--***-->mycohyzzel, powdered <!--***-->humic and fulvic acid blends, compost tea brewing equipment and sprayer, and diatomaceous earth for pest control.
    <br>
    etc.

<hr>
  <h3>
    Breif Recap:
  </h3>
  
    With these examples of what can be accomplished we get closer to year round food growth, locally, without numerous added costs, while implementing many cost reduction strategies, with nearly zero pest issues, no need for fertilizers, to create the ability to grow most of what we desire locally closer to the mouths that eat it.
    <br>
    <br>
    Finally, we infuse renewable energy sources alongside energy storage systems to mitigate all unnecessary costs that utilities can create.
    <br>
    <br>
    We create thermal storage in the ground under the greenhouse floor to 'store' extra greenhouse heat in the dirt for use later on when it is cold.
    <br>
    <br>
    We burry half the greenhouse in the summer to trap more heat in the dirt of the north wall and to be in the ground as an extra layer of protection from the cold.
    <br>
    <br>
    We align the south windows to the winter suns highest solar angle so winter heating is maximized on the shortest days of the year.
    <br>
    <br>
    Then we use soil science (living soil) as well as various planting techniques and add them to other techniques that others have used. More on that later.


<hr>
  <h3>
    Expected outcome:
  </h3>

    The creation of resilient food production systems.
    <br>
    <br>
    Together these can have an important role in our future and for our collective food freedom. 

<hr>

  <h3>
    Summarizing thus far:
  </h3>
  
    We all need plant foods for healthy long lives. Thankfully this can easily be accomplished through the abilities of nature alone. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This all started from observing a forest compared to a field. If you were to do so for long enough you begin to notice that a forest can cycle through layers of dead fall every year with incredible ease, while a field does not do so well in comparison.
    <br>
    <br>
    This happens because of living soil. Which actually happens becase of decomposition of previous plant materials combined with animal wastes, carcasses and more. Together they create an environment that allows a plant to be able to diversely fend (and defend) for itself effectively and successfully year after year without human inputs. No one needs to fertilize the forest to get excellent plant growth, not even once. Seeing that answers all our questions about whether or not we need fertilizers. The answer is still unraveling as we learn more. It is truly a great time to be apart of food growth with new advancements discovered every day who knows what the future will hold.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thanks to dedicated individuals throughout the years we are now able to replicate some of those same symbiotic relationships in a pot. 
    <br>
    <br>

<hr>
<hr>

  <h3>
    How does life get into the soil?:
  </h3>
  
    Further work and observation shows the importance of compost in these relationships. This has brought us to the reality that we can revitalize a field just as easily with compost tea and a sprayer as we can with fertilizer. The difference is that fertilizers have to be reapplied often. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Giving soil back its life is only required in monoculture practices. 
    <br>
    <br>
    With these new strategies in the field we are able to take some soil life and grow it over time using crop rotation and planting certain plant types. More research needed here.
    <br>
    <br>
    Compost tea is a brew made from a handful or two of <!--***-->good compost, placing that in a large barrel with water, some form of <!--***-->food for the microbes and letting that brew in the sun for a week or two. The result is a root innoculent that seeds soil life while vastly improving plant growth for a period of time afterwards.  
    <br>
    <br>
    Compost tea can be made cheeply, it costs significantly less than fertilizers and is sprayed just as easily using similar equipment. 
    <br>

  <h3>
    We all need food for life and our overall health:
  </h3>
  
    Our deepest hope is that one day soon we will all live in a society where no one gets hungry unless they are fasting or for some other reason choose to do be hungry.
    <br>
    <br>
    Reality is that we can feed more people, in more areas of the globe, for less cost and we can do it for almost free all year round... even in areas like Edmonton.

  
<hr>
  
  <h3>
    Yet, to this day, hunger exists:
  </h3>
  
  Did you know that something like a <!--***-->billion people go hungry every day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doen't that sound insane to you?
  <br>
  <br>
  'cause it sure does to me!
  
  <p>
    People should never be hungry! 
       <br>
  Especially when food can <!--***-->grow for almsot free, it is only the labour, storage, resources, and transport that we pay for.
  </p>
  
<hr>
<hr>
  
  <h3>
    Extra costs locally growing can mitigate:
     <!--Might move this to Introduction page-->
  </h3>
  
    <ul>
      <b>What are these avoidable costs:</b>
      <br>
      <li><!--***-->Labour, <!--***-->refrigeration and <!--***-->energy at various <!--***-->warehouses outside of the local region, province, state and country, including <!--***-->loading and un loading at the <!--***-->shipyards.</li>
      <li><!--***-->Trucking between those warehouses and shipyards.</li>
      <br>
      and
      <br>
      <li><!--***-->Fuel required to drive all the trucks and <!--***-->equipment for loading and off loading, as well as the <!--***-->natural resources associated with building ships, equipment, <!--***-->containers, <!--***-->roads, <!--***-->etc.</li>
      <li>Using the resources we use locally and within a <!--***-->Country make sense because we need to get food to people's mouths from where it is grown, there's no doubt about that. However, the rest of it, for the most part is very unnecessary and <i>is</i> what adds significant costs to food when we are shopping at our local grocery store.</li>
    </ul>
    
  Growing locally in greenhouses isn't much better either. Even though they don't have the above costs most greenhouses have other costs like:
      <ul>
        <li>Power.</li>
        <li>Gas (unless electric heat).</li>
        <li>Production gap to shutdown and startup seasonally = many unproductive months.</li>
        <li>Daytime cooling.</li>
        <li>Nighttime heating.</li>
        <li>Water.</li>
        <li>Fertilizer and renewing soil.</li>
        <li>Pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers,etc. When these are needed it is usually the whole room. Greenhouses are huge grow rooms. This = $$$ to knock down pests, moulds, etc., if or whenever it arises.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      These are huge costs as you can see <!--***-->here on page .
      
  <p>
    Fortunately these are all removable costs with the right approach to greenhouse design. Please see project 1 below.
      
<hr>
    
  <h3>
    Universal motivation:
  </h3>
  
    <ul>
      <li>I have been hungry before, it is not fun.</li>
      <li>I have seen ***hunger. This is worse.</li>
      <li>Experimentation <!--***-->growing cannabis led me to try those same techniques on food. I was awe struck at the results. So I am sharing. I hope to start a business growing food this way. If not, at least information is on the <i>big bad web</i> for everyone to see... lol;)</li>
      <br>
      Also:
      <br>
      <li><!--***-->Floods do not affect a <!--***-->greenhouse like they do an open field.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li><!--***-->Produce (healthy food) needs to be affordable to all people, all year, not just on grocery week.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Insurance costs go up after catastrophic loses further creatimg more costs.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li><!--***-->Food waste average in Canada is huge - over 60% from farm to fork. Most of this waste, about 90%, happens before the grocery store shelves. Meaning that between the farm (in a warm climate) and outside our local grocer (warehouse located close by) is where most waste occurs. It is a long journey with mamy stops along the way. The fewer stops there are, and the less number of days in transport (up to a <!--***-->week or more), the better the food will hold up which will result in more ending up at the store and less cost going in your belly. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In other words, long distance transportation is the leading cause to food waste. 
      <br>
      <br>
      If those numbers are accurate then regional food production, or even in country food production would greatly reduce waste by as much as 90%, maybe more.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Nevermind that the cost of energy constantly goes.</li>
      <br>

      <li><!--***-->Holland greenhouses are massive. Some areas it goes on for <!--***-->many kilometers. It is not insane to think that we can grow copius amounts of food under glass.

      <li>Plant health is better becasue of UV light. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304423818300967" target="blank"> UV light. </a> UV is typical blocked with traditional greenhouse glazings. <!--***-->EFTE lets most UV through. ETFE is self cleaning, super light weighing 1/100th the weight of glass, and it never fades according to Japanese gardeners who have used <!--***-->ETFE on their greenhouses for over 30 years.</li>

      <li>A man in Nebraska grows Citrus year round for 50 cents a day. <!--***-->He mamages to keeps temperatures well over 20C all year and he does so by simply blowing air into weaping tile that collect residual thermal heat from in ground around his yard.

  Conclusion:
</h3>

Alegedly we lose up to 70% during shipping so they grow 70% more to account for those loses. This won't need to be true anymore if food is grown locally. Saving us space required to grow that same amount of food because the amount of space we will need to replace that production locally is significantly less. 50-70% less .

  Combined, these projects are able to bring food production closer to our grocery stores in several cost efficent ways. With strategy and technology combined we can reduce many costs, costs that were historically necessary for us to enjoy certain foods year round locally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Never before have we had this combination of technologies available to us. The ability for us to <!--***-->automate and <!--***-->monitor our gardens remotely is unparalleled thanks to COVID. Allowing individuals and families more freedom while reducing costs of labour and resources are certainly assets in some way.
    <br>
    <br>
    Additionally, well tested <!--***-->FTEF is available to glaze our greenhouses. At 1/100th the weight of glass we are able to build the greenhouse normally, as if it had to hold up all that glass and then use the ultra-light <!--***-->ETFE instead giving us immemse weight supporting potential. In turn we support rows of automated verticle rotation garden systems from the roof structure. Doing this will also give room for  extra rows of food in the ground underneath. Combined we can maximize food produced with free sunlight and can even be put these in normal greenhouses.
    <br>
    <br>
    The ability to produce food constantly means fewer months, if any, are spent not growing food for the market. This increases year end production significantly because 6 months aren't shut down for winter. Then seed in the spring and have to wait months to reap the benifits leaving upto 9 months a year not producing unless you use energy to spring and fall heat.
    <br>
    <br>
    On land water collection in hilly areas can save water in ponds and provide it for winter useage for the cost of pumping it.
    <br>
    <br>
    By allowing UV light in we have a naturally stabilized and sanitized grow environment.  Plants are able to protect themselves outside better for this reason and this is typically why infestations and other issues hit greenhouses in the first place, light filtration. 
    <br>
    <br>
    As we know with LEDs, better light means better plants. <!--***-->UV light is a natural sterilizer keeping our qir and water sterilized which we <!--***-->oxygenate to ensure optimal root zone health. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Living soil allows the roots to do what they are designed to do, support the plant. In nature this is automatic. Sadly for years we knew very little as to why this is the case. We now know that the roots <!--***-->communicate through <!--***-->mycelium
    <br>
    <br>
     They are able to warn other plants of disease and selectively grow their roots or not to allow better chance or not for other plants to take hold. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Roots send signals to microbes and through a complicated chain of interactions involving <!--***-->Humic and Fulvic acids, nutrints and water are express delivered through root membranes and into the plant. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Microbes breakdown dirt transforming unusable nutrients and minerals into everything a plant needs to defend it self, feed it self, and keep itself healthy. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Living soil is by far the most benifical. Although the magic truly happens when a person combines all these techniques together.
     <br>
     <br>
     Removing long distance shipping costs as much as possible is important in reducing food prices and reducing resource damands enough to matter. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Groceries account for more of our monthly purchase budget than almost any other item we buy in stores combined. It cost a ton to feed a family for the year. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Being able to grow plants with no worries for super cheap is critical for our futures... unless you want to <!--***-->eat bugs. I know I don't.
     <br>
     <br>
     Eggs, Chicken and milk are major sales items in grocery stores. Providing these closer helps saves money and resources also. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Creating farms that aren't in debt when a farmer starts production will greatly reduce food prices for lack of major overhead right from the start. A farm that starts out of debt and prices their food accordingly prices their food for way less because they won't have to reduce prices once the mortgage is paid off.
     <br>
     <br>
     Food systems that compliment each other are able to provide more cost savings on top of not needing external feed sources because these are purchases and that is money out thus cost added to food sale price.
     <br>
     <br>
     Closed-Loop production close to the mouths that eat is clear in in its advantages.
     <br>
     <br>
     We also can go verticle in southern windows of highrises. Knock out sections of floor near the widows and build the systems between a new wall and the glass keeping most of the office space available (able to see the plants through windows if desired). All while utilizing the huge area of south facing highrise windows and the sun they get. This even helps reduce summer cooling costs.
     <br>
     <br>
     I cant give any more details away without hindering my own business abilities.
     <br>
     <br>
     The rest of this site is an in depth look at all that I have said. I have more information as well as resources galore to help in many topics. Mostly food production and energy, also other things like website building, water pumping for free, electrical learing, free education resources, cources from major universities and colleges, addiction stuff, community stuff, and more.
