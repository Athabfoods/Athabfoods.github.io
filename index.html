        Website Purpose and Intentions:
        </h3>
        
        <p>
        1.Explain the details of what I plan to do with my business in hopes of attracting investors (See greenhouse section). 
        <br>
        This information is valuable to food production and future energy solutions.
        </p> 
        
        <p>
        2. I hope to provide everyone out there with plenty of resources so that making the choice to grow your own food is a clear process. A site containing more than one solution and clear instructions so that anyone can grow virtually anything anywhere are my intentions. 
        <br>
        I hope to provide you with more than enough information to help you catch and prevent costly mistakes which can discourage one from continuing on.

               A bit about me and my growing background.
           </h3>
           
        <p>
        I have learnt alot over the last 15 years of growing <a href="https://www.royalqueenseeds.com/blog-veganic-cannabis-cultivation-takes-organic-to-a-whole-new-level-n332" target=""blank"> Cannabis Veganically </a> and for medical purposes. The lessons taught there truly transfer nicely into food production, with astonishing results too.
        </p>
    
        <p>
        I want you to be able to grow food (or cannabis) for quality with the ease that it should be.

          What I bring:
        </h3>
        
        <p>
        Much of my research over the years has not been focused on one aspect but on many aspects of sustainability and how to reduce future issues globally. I used to be a conspiracy theory buff and a big chunk of my time had been spent in that realm trying to save the world. 
        <br>However rediculous that may be, in the process I stumbled upon many useful scientific studies and resources that now help me be able to share what I am today.

       <h3>
            Why Does our Food Delivery System Need to be Changed?
        </h3>

        <p>
        1. It is <a href="https://1drv.ms/i/s!ApjedxVRObvUgQP_EpK7_tUm7YzV?e=FbbBaT" target=""blank"> inefficient</a> and complicated.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        2.We pay for our food, something that mostly grows for free mostly because of shipping, warehousing and to cover losses due to waste.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        3.As seen with the picture chart from point #1 above, it is very complicated, which means it costs alot by the time you purchase it at the store, this is because of all of the logistics involved.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        4.Shipping time means your food is picked early enough to be <a href="https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/CAN/Year/LTST/TradeFlow/Import/Partner/by-country/Product/16-24_FoodProd" target=""blank"> shipped</a>, sit at a warehouse, be shipped again, sit at the grocery store waiting for you to pick it up. This does two things, one, you get something that is not very fresh when picked and thus it does not taste as good as it could and two, it has traveled upwards of 15,000 km or more and much of it along the way has <a href="https://www.rcinet.ca/en/2021/03/06/new-report-provides-numbers-on-how-much-food-is-wasted-in-canada/" target=""blank"> rotted and been tossed </a>.
       <br>
        Also ships use huge <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4uMX5mWAF4" target=""blank">engines</a>, burning large amounts of fuel. (Mega Diesel Engine | Exceptional Engineering | Free Documentary)
        </p>
        
        <p>
        5.Most Greenhouses are poorly designed <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Ffigure%2FEvaporative-cooling-boxes-in-greenhouse_fig2_277674004&psig=AOvVaw29u3IS96FRNGPxTiwE2t9f&ust=1689276713499000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=2ahUKEwi5tOCk9ImAAxWIIjQIHed7D9QQr4kDegUIARDWAQ" target=""blank"> cooling </a> and <a href="https://www.bridgegreenhouses.co.uk/renewable/" target=""blank"> heating </a>.

        <p>
        6.<a href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!ApjedxVRObvUfhV8GxX7mQSFm80?e=pVAzRD" target=""blank"> Costs </a> to heat and cool greenhouses are enormous. 
        <br>(see pages 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 for 2019 Alberta Greenhouse Crops report on costs by the Alberta Government).
        </p>
        
        <p>
        7.Pesticides, Fertilizers, etc.
        <br>
        (please see pages 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 from the last link).
        </p> 
        
        <p>As you can see, aside from growing media, fertilizers and chemicals, energy usage is the largest expense for growing food indoors here in Alberta. And ***Canada in general.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        8.Monoculture is a practice that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8838759/" target=""blank"> depletes soil </a> life over time, this is why our farming practices are failing now.
        </p> 
        
        <p>
        9.Impact on environment with certain fertilizers and wastes accumulate over the years, some are toxic like pest control, others are compostable and sellable.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        10.Energy is <a href="https://energyregulationquarterly.ca/articles/a-historical-and-comparative-perspective-on-ontarios-electricity-rates#sthash.ci2gqjDA.JhTXLMUg.dpbs" target=""blank"> ever increasing </a> in cost, which means  that as time goes on, food becomes increasingly more expensive regardless of any other efficencies, energy is an ever ominous shadow that threatens long term feasibility of any design that does not mitigate their uses at least by 95%.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        11.If <a href="https://greenhouseinthesnow.com/" target=""blank"> food can be produced </a> further north in unlickly climates, just imagine what can be done for many people globally.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        12.Check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Pg3gY7wQ4" target=""blank"> this guy </a> out near olds Alberta. <br> <b>Make sure</b> you see just how warm he has his greenhouse shortly after Christmas in Alberta in 2021, which was a very very cold month and winter up here. (Think -30 average for the whole of December) Yet he manages over 20C from the Suns energy alone, and a blanket at night.

        <h3>
            AthaBee Greenhouse:
        </h3>

        <h4>
            Vision
        </h4>
        
    <p>
        To create a greenhouse system that allows for the growth of foods grown in warmer climates, foods typically grown tropically, sub-tropically, or temperate grown, and bring them into regions where these foods could never be grown.
    </p>

        <h4>
            Goals
        </h4>
        

    <p>
         -Use solar thermal energy to create a year round equal growing climate.
         <br>
         -Use mother nature as a teacher. Soil life matters, and so we try to replicate what she does in the wild into each and every garden pot we mix.
         <br>
         -Utilize glazing products (glass) )that promote more of the suns rays to penetrate. Being immensely lighter than glass and quite a bit lighter than various kinds of plastics, ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) is by far one of the more superior choices in greenhouse glazing. Due to its properties it is ultra light, self cleaning, able to be layered for insulating against the cold, as well as letting 99% of the suns ray spectrum in, which is what plants are used to outside and grow best under.
         <br>
         -We will utilize renewable energy and various energy storage methods. There is a whole section on this planned for down the road.
         <br>
         -Research on soil life, proliferation, sustainability, and what all of that does to plants exactly, as well as recording results and keeping slides along the way. We hope to be able to provide this freely to the internet. Not behind a pay wall, gimmick, or ploy to sell stuff. You will see little sales being done here. 
         <br> 
         EVERYTHING is to be for public use. All lessons learned will be shared. Along side our results will be photos, videos, charts and what ever else we feel is important to making it easy for you to succeed in a garden, or a market production garden to start a business.
         
    </p>
    
        <h4>
            Customers and Delivery.
        </h4>
    
    <p>
        Many grocers around here accept locally grown foods, we plan to hit a niche market that is pretty dead locked on its prices and quite simply everyone eats. Ever further still, fresh and local is a chiice people rather make especially if it is not more money like most organic... I cant figure out why "organic" has come to meam "more expensive". 
        <br>
        Since we will be able to sell at a much lower rate than what it costs to plant, grow, be picked, get trucked, be stored, then shipped 10,000km, stored again in seacans in a shipyard, then trucked again to a warehouse,  from the warehouse - trucked again to stocks in your store and then to the grocery shelves. That is alot of steps to the local store. Anything grown locally and for only the costs of labour and local shipping has got to be less expensive than what it takes to do the same farm labour add all those steps in between going to the same store that for me is max a couple hundred kilometers away.
        <br>
        There are also Farmers Markets as an alternative. 
        <br>
        As a last resort, a highway stand or parkinglot thing are options.
        <br>
        Finally, our on line presences. I plan to do a fair bit of marketing once I am able to hire a marketer. As well as get an app built for home delivery, or on site specific pickup. 
        <br>
        The ultimate end goal would be to have as much automated as possible as well as having some sort of drone delivery that enables from farm to fork implementation and a person wouldn't even have to leave their house.

        <h4>
            Motivation
        </h4>
    
    <p>
        All of our tropical / subtropical foods ***travels about 10,000 km or more to reach Canada.
        <br>
        Most freight croses the ocean to get here making the most economical transport a ***massive container ship. These ships burn ***immense volumes of fuel. For a 100,000 ***TEU (20 foot equivalent units. Meaning 100,000 20foot seacans can fit on one vessel) burns _______***tons of fuel. One ton equals ____*** number of liters.
        <br>
        Food costs in remote regions like ***Northwest Territories or ***Nunuvit are enormous, any food production system that allows food to be grown further north may be able to mitigate their food cost burden greatly, if this design is proven useful here.
        <br>
        Drake *** Landing in Alberta shows the potential of solar thermal storage.
        <br>
        Water can be pumped up hill for free with a ***ram pump allowing for some areas to take advantage of hills to collect water and pump it to a greenhouse for zero pennies a liter.
        <br>
        Mutart *** Conservatory showcases a variety of plants being growth under glass year round in Edmonton. Further highlighting the reality of the incredible variety of plants that can be grown this far north.
        <br>
        Soil Companies like ***Gaia and ***Fox Farms exist which pre mix very useful soil combinations making soil purchase easy. *** Subcools super soil is another way to learn how to make your own if you desire. 
        <br>
        Greenhouses in ***Holland show that it is not far out idea to do massive production indoors. 
        <br>
        Verticle ***Farms show that you can go up alot and with the massive reduction of weight gained by ETFE, one can now habg alot of plants off of the building structure without need for heavier engineering in the building design.
        <br>
        Add the ***guy in Olds from above and you get more proof that a greenhouse in Alberta can maintain year round conditions that are adequate for year round plant growth of plants that demand higher year round lower temperatures.
        <br>
        Olds ***college shows excellent proof of plant water filtering abilities.

        Doing it extraordinary requires dedication to observe closely plants and general life of your garden and to take measurements periodically and then to slowly adjust over some years.

          This type of soil has many names; <a href="https://lomi.com/blogs/news/what-is-living-soil?nbt=nb%3Aadwords%3Ax%3A20199478977%3A%3A&nb_adtype=&nb_kwd=&nb_ti=&nb_mi=&nb_pc=&nb_pi=&nb_ppi=&nb_placement=&nb_si={sourceid}&nb_li_ms=&nb_lp_ms=&nb_fii=&nb_ap=&nb_mt=&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYjQgd6OgAMVyQetBh1aUwFZEAMYASAAEgKy7vD_BwE&campaignid=20199478977&adgroupid=&targetid=&creative=&network=x&device=c&utm_source=google" target=""blank"> Living </a> Soil, Veganic Soil, <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/subcools-super-soil-step-by-step/" target=""blank"> Supersoil </a>, <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/biodiversity/mycorrhizal-fungi" target=""blank"> Mycorrhizal Fungi (IMPORTANT) </a> and Soil, Substrate, <a href="https://www.hgtv.com/outdoors/gardens/planting-and-maintenance/how-to-amend-garden-soil" target=""blank"> Amended Soil </a>, among some names.

            <p>
            In a way the soil is fertilizer because the plants health comes from the fact that the soil is digested by microbe life and the dirt it self is the food for that life.
            <br>
            Intrestingly enough, most soils that are producing poorly are not in need of amending but instead just in need of having microbe life revitalized. 
          <br>
          Why does soil become life less over time? <a href="https://eos.com/blog/monoculture-farming/" target=""blank"> Monoculture (IMPORTANT). </a>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Over the years I have tried many soil amendment recipes and combinations.
          <br>
          From very complicated mixes to simply adding one, two, or a few certain products to normal outside field dirt. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
          I have discovered have some very impactful things while experimenting last year. More testing is needed, but if those results are accurate, ... my oh my ... what a potential to the future of food production that will be!
        </p>
        
        <p>              
       Growing food takes alot of dedication to do so in a truly sustainable way, I am one who is has been up taking on this challenge for years.
       </p>
       
       <p> Why am I the one for the job?
       <br> Because in the past, before it was legal, without a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_to_Cannabis_for_Medical_Purposes_Regulations#:~:text=Medical%20cannabis%20was%20first%20legalized,medical%20purposes%20would%20be%20permitted." target=""blank">MMAR</a> to grow cannabis, growing it was always a competition and challenge to see who could make the best tasting buds that got you the most baked. When I discovered <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/subcools-super-soil-step-by-step/" target=""blank">SubCool's Soil</a> Recipe, I was hooked. 
       </p>
       
       <p>
       It was a chance I am glad I took because I discovered how much soil life matters is equally important to what that soil life is processing.
       </p>
       
       <p>
        Nutrients (fertilizers) are equal to amendments in this type of setup. 
       <br>What they do to the quality of a plant is beyond comprehension. 
       </p>
       
       <p>
         This type of gardening has potential to offer real problem solving solutions to growers of any kind. 
       <p>
         
       </p>
       Personally knowing the results of subcool's veganics on cannabis for almost 10 years along side the last few years of bringing those ideas to the garden tell me that food production can benefit greatly. 
       <br>
       Why? because cannabis buds are technically flowers, which is the part that fruits on edible plants.

        Agriculture's Potential Future:
      </h3>
        
        <p>
        The reality is that doing things the way we did for so long was simply because there was no other way to do so.That is now in the past and we find ourselves in an era where technology and creative processes can actually impact how things are done significantly. 
        <p>
          
        </p>We stand on the edge of a two way choice, keep up how we do things and stay tied to a life time of careers and retirement for some. Or allow some of the future in becasue it is coming whether or not we want it.

          Sustainable Food Production - What that means to us.
        </h3>
        
    <p>
        Truely sustainable food growth practices are one's that concider all future energy costs input from the grid. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        From concept, one must take the time to plan how to mitigate future cost rises of required energy that is essential to production. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The price of energy has always shown us increase and rarely decrease. For this reason we must adapt how things are done if we hope to curb the longterm impact this will have on food costs. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        As of yet, there are no real solutions being suggested that can help with our energy crisis, a whole section is included near the end with many alternatives.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
        There are countless ideas of what sustainability should look like however, they often fall short and rarely take into account going off grid the as a posibility.

      <h4>
        My Plan:
      </h4>
                   
        <p>
        Sources exist on gardening and food production that provide good advice on specific aspects of growing.
        <br>
However, not many resources exist on how to design a greenhouse that is virtually winter proof while showing why maintaining soil life is an important factor to consider. 
<ul>
    <li>What is <a href="https://www.almanac.com/companion-planting-guide-vegetables" target=""blank">companion planting</a> exactly? </li>
    <li>Witnessing some of the magic found in the symbiotic relationship of companion planting is jaw dropping to be sure.</li> 
    <li>Is it important to provide the full spectrum of the sun including <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304423818300967" target=""blank">UVA and UVB?</a></li>

My plan is to provide a comprehensive website where resources are available for all to use.

        <h2>
            Overall Company Goals and Objectives:
        </h2> 
        
        <p>
         -To bring warm climate food growth out of the south and into regions that are normally thought of as seasonal only.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         -To create multiple food systems that feed people in many different situations according to location. 
         <br>
         Whether you are in the country, the city, an old warehouse, or remotely located these systems provide food with very minimal:
         <ul>
             <li>Costs from grid inputs like gas and electricity</li> 
             <li>Costs to dispose of wastes that can not be recycled</li>
             <li>Cost loss due to deficencies during plant growth</li>
         </ul>
         </p>
     <p>
         These systems work together to provide comprehensive food growth of many varieties within many regions internationally. I am not just trying to grow the hard to grow citrus and produce like listed above, but also provide ways to raise eggs, milk, chickens, fish, and a mix of other plant products such as spices and unique root veggies are all no longer dependant on grow location. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
         -To integrate already standard production practicies together with technology and data to increase production, reduce chemical usage, reduce or eliminate wastes, and use nature as an example in order to promote plant health, vitality and growth longevity.
         </p>
         <p>
         -Show how easy it is to revive soils with simple practicies as well as to show the progression of life revitalization in soil with microscope pictures and video.
         </p>
         <p>
         -Utilize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LFvL_iYVaY" target=""blank"> sybiotic relationships  </a> between plants to provide nutrients from soil food web microbes to improve plant production and produce quality without adding fertilizers, pesticides, herbacides or any chemicals at all. (Link is to Nature of Things Video with David Suzuki about roots of forest plants and how they talk to each other and share resources.)
         </p>
         <p>
         -Take what we learn with the first two aspects of this food system to show the potential of the other, much larger research and development system which is a way to produce food completly off grid with no feedstocks, no energy input at all from any grid source at all.
