<h3>
  Instigating factors:
</h3>

  Food matters greatly yet today, <!--***-->people frequently get hungry. 
    <br>
    <br>
    They claim that we have made mistakes in our fields. We certainly <!--***-->hear about it today more then ever before, but is that true? Are we really at a state of no return in agriculture, or is that just another reason to charge us more money?
  <p>
    It is incredibly difficult to tell because their words are usually <!--***-->ominous sounding and in some ways believable. 
  </p>
    It <!--***-->really doesn't have to be that bad.  Specific designs combined with several techniques allow us to provide food systems where everything good is possible.. :)
    
<hr>

  <h3>
    Journey:
  </h3>

    On my journey of food learning I have often found that the knowledge required to grow <!--***-->veganically (pure <!--***-->vegan organics) was spread accross many websites and information types.
    <br>
    <br>
    I have siffted through oodles to accomplish what I have thus far in my garden. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Forests are phenomenal growth machines where plants seem to be resistant to the various issues that are found in a typical urban garden.
    <br>
    <br>
    Most of what is found on this webisite pertans to plant growth specifically, and how we can have <!--***-->food systems work together in order to reduce costs significantly.
    <p>
    More importantly, I suggest why our system is flawed, showing ways that others have used to <!--***curtis farms-->alleviate their own costs.

  <ol>
    <li>Show how easy it is to <!--*** basement microgreens-->start profitable food producing business at home.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Describe the required <!--***-->components to attain super resiliant plant growth overall, then specifically. </li>
    <br>
    <li>Suggest ways to <!--***-->sell your harvests, locally & legally.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Demonstrate what can be done by anyone to help create their own <!--***-->sustainable food growth systems... practically anywhere.</li>

  <h3>
    What can plants do that is so important to share?:
  </h3>

It is not the plants exactly. More to do with what the amendments and microbes do that is incredible.
<br>
<br>
  Growing plants is not only thrilling. It is rewarding on many levels.
  
  <p>

  Like when you defeat a few frosts and end up with edible food still. Or when the garden survives a wind storm but the rest of the yard doesn't... at all.
  
  </p>

<hr>

<h3>
  Plant super powers:
</h3>
  
  You can't help but wonder how much of it <i>is</i> from the changes you made, or if it's all in your head. 

<h4>
  To much rain. No problem!:
</h4>

  Then you remember that the last time there was a flood and you lost a bunch, or almost everything in one case. And that you have lost plants (and food) every single time something extreme happens. 
  
  <p>

  Then a miracle happens again, but this time you get waaay better results because you decided to push it, just to see, you know? 

  </p>

<h4>
  Freeze resistance too?:
</h4>  
  
  Whoa!!! Not only are your plants alive, I'm thinking these are zombie plants because of how many frosts they have been through. Yet somehow these potted green beauties are green leafed, supple and alive enough while the rest of the garden is frozen stiff to the point that touching any part breaks it. This is typical with a frozen plant.
  
<h4>
  Compared to what exactly?:
</h4>

  These frozen plants are right beside my 'special pots', with the amendments and the sciency stuff I did to them, with soil life I think is there but have no proof that <i>it is</i> actually <i>in there</i> even though for the third year in a row plants are doing things that plants don't normally do. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Flora (plants) don't normally survive certain conditions in normal field soil as mentioned. Most plants (flora) also can't really handle torrential down pours, but these amended ones do. 
  
<h4>
  Not just once either!:
</h4>  

  <p>
    Plants that don't freeze and are still movable as if not frozen (their leaves and stems) is unheard of at -5C after a night that was colder. But its happened. Twice now.
  </p>
  
    The second time they survived several frosts in a row because they were planted in pots of living soil as opposed to normal soil... what ever that means, right? 

<h4>
  All because of soil hey?:
</h4>

  <p>
    All the aformentioned things that happened becasue I amended the soil and then revitalized its life. 
    <br>
    In other words,by simply promoting life, and adding certain other ingredients into the soil I was able to acheive those incredible things in my gardens, in my pots and while growing anything indoors. 
    </p>

<hr>


<h3>
  And then?:
</h3>

  Imagine if we took the above soil improvements and all the incredible things that does and then we introduced the following?:
  
  <ul>
    <li>Building design enhancments</li>
    <li>Special greenhouse technologies</li>
    <li>Automation</li>
    <li>Companion planting</li>
    <li>Symbiotic planing</li>
    <li>Consideration for what a plant provides to the soil in its life (rotational croping)</li>
    <li>Thermal battery (heat storage)</li>
    <li>Water oxygenation</li>
    <li>On site energy production and storage</li>
  </ul>

<hr>

<h3>
  From my experience:
</h3>

  To name a few improvements. Above, aside from building designs and energy production, I have tried then tested them and I confirm they work individually and combined. Then I tested the soils alongside some or many of those ideas. This is why I feel that the more we combine the better the outcome will be.
 
<p>
    What I have not tried yet is growing indoors with automation in any of the buildings outlined so I have yet been able to combine those ideas with all the sciency soil and plant stuff.
  </p>

<hr>
<hr>

  <h3>
    Plants need these to live and grow:
  </h3>
  
    We all know that when a plant grows it needs some basic ingredients, right?
      <ul>
        <li>Things like energy - from the sun or lights</li>
        <li>Food - through the root system</li>
        <li>Water - from various sources</li>
        and
        <li>CO2 - From the air (what we exhale)</li>
      </ul>

<hr>

<h3>
  Rationalization:
</h3>

      
  <p>
As you can see things aren't always so simple. What we used to think was enough to keep a plant healthy was actually severly lacking. In reality, the scope of required 'things' that I am suggesting needs to be done can seem daunting. Most of these suggestions are not typical topics when it comes to seeking greenhouse advice. 
</p>

Even though we can grow plants by simply watering enough while making sure they have enough sun light. What can be accomplished with this style of approach can be profound. 
<br>
<br>
Best part is that it does not take more work in the end. By taking a slightly different approach to start with we end up with results that speak for themselves. 

<hr>
<hr>

<h3>
  My favorite part! Plant and soil science:
</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Mirobes. Some call them 'myco's' or <!-- ***-->'mycohyzzyl' which are fungi (mushroom).</li>
      <li>We need a source of these microbes. Compost tea, humus, compost, store bought inocculant cocktail, micro brew, etc. are all excellent sources of soil life. When we put these things on, or in our soil we say we are 'inoculatibg it'.</li>
      <li>Microbes need to eat something, so at first we need to give them food until they get going. As long as the root zone and soil immediately around the root zone are not disturbed the microbes will take hold. Until then we use sugar (de-sulfurated molasses) water with a humic acid blend and/or more inoculant / brew once a month.</li>
      <li>They need good water and adequate sun light. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Artificial lights work but are really expensive if paying for the equipment and the power bill.</li>
      <li>A person should also monitor the propogation of microbes throughout the soil through a microscope. <!--***-->see microscope section - Coming soon.</li>
    </ul>
  
<h4>
  Plants and Oxygen:
</h4>
  
  <p>  
    Did you know that <!--***-->plants require Oxygen also? 
  </p>
  
  They do. Not much, but they do.
  <br>
  <br>
  In nature, it usually happens when rain falls. As raindrops fall they become concentrated with O2, when a drop hits the ground it takes that trapped oxygen into the ground with it. This oxygenates the roots which helps the roos do their routine better as well asding to the other positive effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Why? Oxygen promotes the roots to help plants process starches and sugars more efficiently. We all know how esential sugars are to photosynthesis. Well photosynthesis has another waste besides Oxygen, it's starch and thus very importat to process well. 

<h4>
  One single plant breath:
</h4>

<p>
  A plant sort of breathes once per day. 
</p>
During the day oxygen is exchanged out the leaves while absorbing carbon dioxide. 

<h4>
  Roots need Oxygen too:
</h4>

This happens while the roots take in Oxygen and expel CO2. 
<p>
  During the night most plants stop its oxygen production while the roots turn day time produced starches back into sugars and other things the plant needs.
</p>

<h4>
  Lightnings effects on rain:
</h4>

  Lightning atomizes the air with every strike.
   There are studies that suggest this helps sterilize the water by atomizing the atmosphere around rain as it falls. 
   <br>

<h3>
  Veganics can put the following in the rearview:
</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Fertilizing.</li>
    <li>Occasional pests, moulds, etc.</li>
    <li>Root zone issues with over watering.</li>
    <li>Weather damage- wind, hail etc.</li>
    <li>Heating and cooling costs.</li>
    <li>Short seasons due to cold.</li>
    <li>Even shorter season length in Northern climates due to winter.</li>
    <li>Lost quality because of long distance shippeding.</li>
    <li>Short life of most produce after purchase.</li>
    <li>Major watering costs, in most cases.</li>
    <li>Spring and Fall growth slowdown due to temperature.</li>
    <li>Not avoidable minor costs might include tools, pots, watering equipmemt, sprayers, pruners, etc. These are typically one time purchases only.</li>
  </ul>

<hr>  

<h3>
  The free part:
</h3>
  
  The actual growing of a plant is done by the soil, the water and the sunlight. We actually do nothing there. What we have to do is plant the seeds or seedlings, weed throughout the year and then harvest. The rest, besides watering, should be free.
  
<hr>

<h3>
  Reducing other costs:
</h3>

<h4>
  Weeding time:
</h4>

Time weeding is mitogated by top dressing the base of plants or using filter cloth weed stop. You can also use cardboard to stop weeds. Cardboard eventually becomes part of the soil feeding it slightly. 
  <br>
  <br>
For plants just cut holes in the above weed stop material that are slightly bigger than the trunk or stem will be This reduces the area needing to be weeded significantly, saving many hours of time. 
<br>
<br>
Another way to slow weeds is with wood chips, shredded bark, grass clippings, or raked up yard leaves.

<h4>
  Seeding time:
</h4>

You can use an <!--***-->auto seeder or <!--***-->hand held seeder to save time.

<h4>
  Harvesting time:
</h4>

<!--***-->Microgreens harvester. Different <!--***Lee valley-->hand held tools. Automated harvesting drones.

<h4>
  Watering time:
</h4>

Automated <!--***-->watering with in ground sensors. Run aquarium bubbler in water at all times. Store water in opaque tanks that are in direct sun light for <!--***-->UV steralization.

<h4>
  Watering costs:
</h4>

Collect rain water and snow runoff from buildings. Dehumidify water alongside. Water wells. Land run off diversion and collection then use <!--Rampumps--> rampumps to pump water for free. Or solar power and batteries to pump as back up.

<h4>
  Energy costs:
</h4>

Produce electricity on site and store it. See <!--***-->energy section for more information on this.

<h4>
  Artificial lighting:
</h4>

There is one form of efficent HID lighting, caled <!--***-->plasma lights. These beauties are super efficient. They do not have to be close to a plant to be ablke to cast enough light to the branches. They can hang on the roof and provide light through the entire depth to the ground with no need for multiple lights side by side. 

<hr>
<hr>

<h3>
  Over watering:
</h3>

<p>
Some plants can not tollerate being wet for extended periods. These plants get <!--Rootrot-->root rot easily and must be prevented at all costs.
</p> 
  
  Be sure to check your plant variety online or at an <!--extention office-->extention office website to see if your variety can handle base dressings.

  <p>
  *DON'T let any top dressing touch stems of plants or tree trunks. Always keep back 3+ inches and only an inch or two thick.
</p>
  
<hr>
<hr>

<h3>
  To summarize thus far:
</h3>

  It turns out that growing a plant can be easy but often growing it simply ends up being more work than planned.
  <br>
  <br>
Even though it seems like many moving parts in fact it only sounds that way. It is more about knowing what to watch for and then reacting ahead of _______ becoming an issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Setting it all up is the hardest part. Once things get going though, it only becomes easier and more efficient the longer conditions are maintained. Which is why I mentioned microscope skills they are required. Thankfully those skills can <!--***-->easily be learnt in this day and age.

<hr>
<hr>

<h3>
  Light matters to plants:
</h3>

    Last and almsot the most important fact is the type of light a plant gets. Plants grow best under the sun, plain and simple. Indoors or outdoors, it doesn't matter. The best growth rates come from the sun, hands down! 
    <br>
    <br>
    Because HID lights cost a lot and get way to hot indoors to provide less <!--***-->lumens then the sun can naturaly. 
    <p>
      Lumens are the amount of light energy (photons) per square foot that hits a plants leaf surface. More lumens equals faster and more robust growth. 
    </p>

    Since these lights are crazy expensive for both the low powered option *<!--***-->LED (set up costs), or the amount of <!--***-->energy used with the HID option. 
    

  <!--Show costs for lights below-->  
    <p>
    Bulbs only last so long and must eventually be replaced. Even for LEDs. Although LEDs are significantly longer life span they still do have a maximum service life and are many fold more expensive then high pressure sodium or metal halide bulbs.
    </p>
    
<hr>

<h3>
  <!--***-->FETF:
</h3>

    Glazing (glass over the greehouse) choice is crutial. 
    <p>
      My choice is <!--***-->FETF, which is described <!--***-->here (under construction).
    </p>
    
<!--Add link to projects page-->

<hr>
<hr>

  <h3>
    Initial set up:
  </h3>
    Like with anything, you have to purchase items to start out. Things like soil, pots, watering systems, ventilation, greenhouse structure, etc., all need purchasing anyways. Simply substitute some of the initial items for certain other ones instead and in the long run less is spent.
    <br>
    <br>
    Instead of soil buy <!--***-->pre amended <!--***-->starter soils.
    <br>
    <br>
    Instead of ventilation, heating and cooling invest in <!--***-->GHAT style greenhouse.
    <br>
    <br>
    Instead of glass buy <!--***-->FETF.
    <br>
    <br>
    Instead of pesticides, herbacides and fertilizers buy amendments for every now and then, <!--***-->neem oil or neem cake, <!--***-->mycohyzzel, powdered <!--***-->humic and fulvic acid blends, compost tea brewing equipment and sprayer, and diatomaceous earth for pest control.
    <br>
    <br>
    etc.

<hr>
  <h3>
    Breif Recap:
  </h3>
  
    With these examples of what can be accomplished we get closer to year round food growth, locally, without numerous added costs, while implementing many cost reduction strategies, with nearly zero pest issues, no need for fertilizers, to create the ability to grow most of what we desire locally closer to the mouths that eat it.
    <br>
    <br>
    Finally, we infuse renewable energy sources alongside energy storage systems to mitigate all unnecessary costs that utilities can create.
    <br>
    <br>
    We create thermal storage in the ground under the greenhouse floor to 'store' extra greenhouse heat in the dirt for use later on when it is cold.
    <br>
    <br>
    We burry half the greenhouse in the summer to trap more heat in the dirt of the north wall and to be in the ground as an extra layer of protection from the cold.
    <br>
    <br>
    We align the south windows to the winter suns highest solar angle so winter heating is maximized on the shortest days of the year.
    <br>
    <br>
    Then we use soil science (living soil) as well as various planting techniques and add them to other techniques that others have used. More on that later.


<hr>
  <h3>
    Expected outcome:
  </h3>

    The creation of resilient food production systems.
    <br>
    <br>
    Together these can have an important role in our future and for our collective food freedom. 

<hr>

  <h3>
    Summarizing:
  </h3>
  
    We all need plant foods for healthy long lives. Thankfully this can easily be accomplished through the abilities of nature alone. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This all started from observing a forest compared to a field. If you were to do so for long enough you begin to notice that a forest can cycle through layers of dead fall every year with incredible ease, while a field does not do so well in comparison.
    <br>
    <br>
    This happens because of living soil. Which actually happens becase of decomposition of previous plant materials combined with animal wastes, carcasses and more. Together they create an environment that allows a plant to be able to diversely fend (and defend) for itself effectively and successfully year after year without human inputs. No one needs to fertilize the forest to get excellent plant growth, not even once. Seeing that answers all our questions about whether or not we need fertilizers. The answer is still unraveling as we learn more. It is truly a great time to be apart of food growth with new advancements discovered every day who knows what the future will hold.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thanks to dedicated individuals throughout the years we are now able to replicate some of those same symbiotic relationships in a pot. 
    <br>
    <br>

<hr>
<hr>

  <h3>
    Mycellium:
  </h3>
  
    Further work and observation shows the importance of compost in these relationships. This has brought us to the reality that we can revitalize a field just as easily with compost tea and a sprayer as we can with fertilizer. The difference is that fertilizers have to be reapplied often. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Giving soil back its life is only required in monoculture practices. 
    <br>
    <br>
    With these new strategies in the field we are able to take some soil life and grow it over time using crop rotation and planting certain plant types. More research needed here.
   
  <hr>
  
  <h4>
    Compost tea:
  </h4>
    
    Compost tea is a brew made from a handful or two of <!--***-->good compost, placing that in a large barrel with water, some form of <!--***-->food for the microbes and letting that brew in the sun for a week or two. The result is a root innoculent that seeds soil life while vastly improving plant growth for a period of time afterwards.  
    <br>
    <br>
    Compost tea can be made cheeply, it costs significantly less than fertilizers and is sprayed just as easily using similar equipment. 
    <br>
    <br>

  <h3>
    We all need food for life and health:
  </h3>
  
    Our deepest hope is that one day soon we will all live in a society where no one gets hungry unless they are fasting or for some other reason choose to do be hungry.
    <br>
    <br>
    Reality is that we can feed more people, in more areas of the globe, for less cost and we can do it for almost free all year round... even in areas like Edmonton.
  
  <h4>
    Yet hunger exists:
  </h4>
  
  Something like a <!--***-->billion people go hungry every day.
  
  <p>
    People should never be hungry!

    Growing locally can:
     <!--Might move this to Introduction page-->
  </h3>
  
<h4>
  Resources and shipping:
</h4>

    <ul>
      <b>Remove extra costs:</b>
      <br>
      <li><!--***-->Labour, <!--***-->refrigeration and <!--***-->energy at various <!--***-->warehouses outside of the local region, province, state and country, including <!--***-->loading and un loading at the <!--***-->shipyards.</li>
      <br>

      <br>
      and
      <br>
      <br>

      <br>
      Using the resources we use locally and within a <!--***-->Country make sense because we need to get food to people's mouths from where it is grown, there's no doubt about that. However, the rest of it, for the most part is very unnecessary and <i>is</i> what adds significant costs to food when we are shopping at our local grocery store.
    </ul>
    
<h4>
  Typical greenhouses:
</h4>

  Growing locally in a greenhouse isn't much better either. Even though they don't have the above costs that most greenhouses have they have other costs such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Power.</li>
        <li>Gas (unless electric heat).</li>
        <li>Production gap to shutdown and startup seasonally = many unproductive months.</li>
        <li>Daytime cooling.</li>
        <li>Nighttime heating.</li>
        <li>Water.</li>
        <li>Fertilizer and renewing soil.</li>
        <li>Pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers,etc. When these are needed it is usually the whole room. Greenhouses are huge grow rooms. This = $$$ to knock down pests, moulds, etc., if or whenever it arises.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      These are huge see <!--***-->here.
      
  <p>
    Fortunately these are all removable costs with the right approach to greenhouse design. Please see project 1 below.

      <li><!--***-->Produce (healthy food) needs to be affordable to all people, all year, not just on grocery week.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Insurance costs go up after catastrophic loses further creatimg more costs.</li>

      <li><!--***-->Food waste average in Canada is huge - over 60% from farm to fork. Most of this waste, about 90%, happens before the grocery store shelves. Meaning that between the farm (in a warm climate) and outside our local grocer (warehouse located close by) is where most waste occurs. It is a long journey with mamy stops along the way. The fewer stops there are, and the less number of days in transport (up to a <!--***-->week or more), the better the food will hold up which will result in more ending up at the store and less cost going in your belly. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In other words, long distance transportation is the leading cause to food waste. 
      <br>
      <br>
      If those numbers are accurate then regional food production, or even in country food production would greatly reduce waste by as much as 90%, maybe more.</li>

ETFE is self cleaning, super light weighing 1/100th the weight of glass, and it never fades according to Japanese gardeners who have used <!--***-->ETFE on their greenhouses for over 30 years.</li>

  Conclusion:
</h3>

Alegedly we lose up to 70% during shipping so they grow 70% more to account for those loses. This won't need to be true anymore if food is grown locally. Saving us space required to grow that same amount of food because the amount of space we will need to replace that production locally is significantly less. 50-70% less .

  Combined, these projects are able to bring food production closer to our grocery stores in several cost efficent ways. With strategy and technology combined we can reduce many costs, costs that were historically necessary for us to enjoy certain foods year round locally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Never before have we had this combination of technologies available to us. The ability for us to <!--***-->automate and <!--***-->monitor our gardens remotely is unparalleled thanks to COVID. Allowing individuals and families more freedom while reducing costs of labour and resources are certainly assets in some way.
    <br>
    <br>
    Additionally, well tested <!--***-->FTEF is available to glaze our greenhouses. At 1/100th the weight of glass we are able to build the greenhouse normally, as if it had to hold up all that glass and then use the ultra-light <!--***-->ETFE instead giving us immemse weight supporting potential. In turn we support rows of automated verticle rotation garden systems from the roof structure. Doing this will also give room for  extra rows of food in the ground underneath. Combined we can maximize food produced with free sunlight and can even be put these in normal greenhouses.
    <br>
    <br>
    The ability to produce food constantly means fewer months, if any, are spent not growing food for the market. This increases year end production significantly because 6 months aren't shut down for winter. Then seed in the spring and have to wait months to reap the benifits leaving upto 9 months a year not producing unless you use energy to spring and fall heat.
    <br>
    <br>
    On land water collection in hilly areas can save water in ponds and provide it for winter useage for the cost of pumping it.
    <br>
    <br>
    By allowing UV light in we have a naturally stabilized and sanitized grow environment.  Plants are able to protect themselves outside better for this reason and this is typically why infestations and other issues hit greenhouses in the first place, light filtration. 
    <br>
    <br>
    As we know with LEDs, better light means better plants. <!--***-->UV light is a natural sterilizer keeping our qir and water sterilized which we <!--***-->oxygenate to ensure optimal root zone health. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Living soil allows the roots to do what they are designed to do, support the plant. In nature this is automatic. Sadly for years we knew very little as to why this is the case. We now know that the roots <!--***-->communicate through <!--***-->mycelium
    <br>
    <br>
     They are able to warn other plants of disease and selectively grow their roots or not to allow better chance or not for other plants to take hold. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Roots send signals to microbes and through a complicated chain of interactions involving <!--***-->Humic and Fulvic acids, nutrints and water are express delivered through root membranes and into the plant. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Microbes breakdown dirt transforming unusable nutrients and minerals into everything a plant needs to defend it self, feed it self, and keep itself healthy. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Living soil is by far the most benifical. Although the magic truly happens when a person combines all these techniques together.
     <br>
     <br>
     Removing long distance shipping costs as much as possible is important in reducing food prices and reducing resource damands enough to matter. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Groceries account for more of our monthly purchase budget than almost any other item we buy in stores combined. It cost a ton to feed a family for the year. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Being able to grow plants with no worries for super cheap is critical for our futures... unless you want to <!--***-->eat bugs. I know I don't.
     <br>
     <br>
     Eggs, Chicken and milk are major sales items in grocery stores. Providing these closer helps saves money and resources also. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Creating farms that aren't in debt when a farmer starts production will greatly reduce food prices for lack of major overhead right from the start. A farm that starts out of debt and prices their food accordingly prices their food for way less because they won't have to reduce prices once the mortgage is paid off.
     <br>
     <br>
     Food systems that compliment each other are able to provide more cost savings on top of not needing external feed sources because these are purchases and that is money out thus cost added to food sale price.
     <br>
     <br>
     Closed-Loop production close to the mouths that eat is clear in in its advantages.
     <br>
     <br>
     We also can go verticle in southern windows of highrises. Knock out sections of floor near the widows and build the systems between a new wall and the glass keeping most of the office space available (able to see the plants through windows if desired). All while utilizing the huge area of south facing highrise windows and the sun they get. This even helps reduce summer cooling costs.
     <br>
     <br>
     I cant give any more details away without hindering my own business abilities.
     <br>
     <br>
     The rest of this site is an in depth look at all that I have said. I have more information as well as resources galore to help in many topics. Mostly food production and energy, also other things like website building, water pumping for free, electrical learing, free education resources, cources from major universities and colleges, addiction stuff, community stuff, and more.
