        </p> 
        
        <p>
        Some may find literature to be really boring stuff to read. It can be, but please try to read the first sections of these papers. Papers follow the <a href="https://www.amnh.org/explore/videos/the-scientific-process" target=""blank">scientific method (Important)</a> which means that what you learn has been through a set of steps to test and validate its reliability.

            Why Does our Food Delivery System Need to be adjusted?
        </h2>

        <p>
        1. It is <a href="https://1drv.ms/i/s!ApjedxVRObvUgQP_EpK7_tUm7YzV?e=FbbBaT" target=""blank"> very inefficient</a>
        </p>

      <h3> 
        10 Major problems that cost you more:
      </h3>
        
        <p>
        1.We ***pay for our ***food and it is worse the further*** north one goes(showing crazy food prices in remote areas) something that mostly ***grows for free (show fields and sun). A big part of that cost is influenced by long distance shipping and all that that takes to accomplish. While traveling this huge distance, about 25% goes bad, by the time it gets to Canada, estimates are around ***half of what leaves the farm reaches your store, at which point about half to three quarters is able to be sold before it too goes ***bad. End result is that upwards of 70% of can be lost during this process...
        </p>
        
        <p>
        2.As seen with the picture from point #1 above, it is very complicated, which adds to the purchase cost at the store. This is because of all of the logistics involved.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        3.To account for shipping time means your food is picked early enough to be <a href="https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/CAN/Year/LTST/TradeFlow/Import/Partner/by-country/Product/16-24_FoodProd" target=""blank"> shipped</a>, sit at a warehouse, be shipped again, then sit at the grocery store waiting for you to pick it up. This does two things, one, you get something that is not very fresh when picked and thus it does not taste as good as it could and two, it has traveled upwards of 15,000 km or more and much of it along the way has <a href="https://www.rcinet.ca/en/2021/03/06/new-report-provides-numbers-on-how-much-food-is-wasted-in-canada/" target=""blank"> rotted and been tossed </a>.
       <br>
        Also, ships use huge <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4uMX5mWAF4" target=""blank">engines</a>, burning large amounts of fuel. (Mega Diesel Engine | Exceptional Engineering | Free Documentary)
        </p>
        
        <p>
        4.Most Greenhouses are poorly designed <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Ffigure%2FEvaporative-cooling-boxes-in-greenhouse_fig2_277674004&psig=AOvVaw29u3IS96FRNGPxTiwE2t9f&ust=1689276713499000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=2ahUKEwi5tOCk9ImAAxWIIjQIHed7D9QQr4kDegUIARDWAQ" target=""blank"> cooling </a> and <a href="https://www.bridgegreenhouses.co.uk/renewable/" target=""blank"> heating </a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        5.<a href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!ApjedxVRObvUfhV8GxX7mQSFm80?e=pVAzRD" target=""blank"> Costs </a> to heat and cool greenhouses are enormous. 
        <br>(see pages 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 of 2019 Alberta Greenhouse Crops report on costs by the Alberta Government)
        </p>
        
        <p>
        6.Pesticides, Fertilizers, etc.
        <br>
        (please see the same pages above, page #s 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 from last link from number 6).
        </p> 
        
        <p>Looking closer you can see, growing medium costs, fertilizers, chemicals and energy costs are by far the most in every report. Mitigating these huge costs are easy with the right design of greenhouse.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        7.Monoculture is a practice that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8838759/" target=""blank"> depletes soil </a> life over time, this is why our farming practices are struggling now.
        </p> 
        
        <p>
        8.The impact on environment with certain fertilizers and wastes accumulate over the ***years(bluegreen algae). Some are toxic like pest ***controls (glyphosate), others wastes are ***compostable (how to compost) and can be sold.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        9.Energy is <a href="https://energyregulationquarterly.ca/articles/a-historical-and-comparative-perspective-on-ontarios-electricity-rates#sthash.ci2gqjDA.JhTXLMUg.dpbs" target=""blank"> ever increasing </a> in cost, which means  that as time goes on, food becomes increasingly more expensive regardless of any other efficencies, energy is an ever ominous shadow that threatens long term feasibility of any design that does not mitigate their uses at least by 95%.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        10.If <a href="https://greenhouseinthesnow.com/" target=""blank"> food can be produced </a> further north in unlickly climates, just imagine what can be done for many people globally.

        <h3>
            Project vision:
        </h3>
        
    <p>
        To create a greenhouse system that allows for the growth of foods grown in warmer climates, foods typically grown tropically, subtropically, or temperate grown, and bring them into regions where these foods could never be grown. Like Edmonton, Alberta.
    </p>
    
<hr>

        <h3>
            Project goals:
        </h3>
        

    <p>
        <ol>
          <li>-Use solar ***thermal energy storage to create a year round equal growing climate.</li>
          <br>
          <li>-Use ***(fungus guy) mother ***nature (Natre magazine) as a ***teacher (David Suzuki- Nature of Things). Soil life ***matters (comparison of weed grown with and without supersoil), and so we try to replicate what she does in the wild into each and every garden pot we mix we make.</li>
          <br>
          <li>-Utilize glazing products (glass) that promote more of the ***suns rays (ETFE data) to penetrate. Being immensely ***lighter (more ETFE data) than glass and quite a bit lighter than various kinds of ***plastics (Chart comparing greenhouse glazing weights), ***ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) is by far one of the more superior choices for ***glazing a greenhouse. This is due to its properties as a ***greenhouse covering. it is ultra ***light (repeat link), ***self cleaning, able to be ***layered for insulating against the cold, as well as letting 99% of the suns ray ***spectrum in. Plants are used to being ***outside and grow best outside because of the suns rays. Pests that are an issue in greenhouses are an issue partly because of the fact that other glazings can block ***UVA, ***UVB, ***UBC (effects on plants), some combination of them or all of ***them (glazing data or chart or both on light passivity).</li>
          <br>
          <li>-We will utilize ***renewable energy and ***various energy ***storage methods. There is a whole section on this planned for down the road. Look for Energy further down. <b><u>(not yet. check back soon) </u></b></li>
          <br>
          <li>-Research and collect data on ***soil life (microscopes link), ***proliferation (stages of soil life book), ***sustainability (how to maintain soil life with molases and liquid karma), and what all of that does to ***plants (plant nutrient, as well as micro and macro nutrient requirement) exactly, as well as ***recording (sensors in dirt at farm in germany video) results and ***keeping microscope slides, ***photos, ***videos and ***measurements along the way.</li>
          <br>
          <li>-We hope to be able to provide this information for free on the internet. Hence the cheap ***HTML code (HTML coding video) website for now.</li>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>This will always remain free and never behind a pay wall.</li> 
            <br>
            <li>No gimmicks, or ploys to sell you stuff.</li>
            <br>
            <li>No email sign up required so you can access data.</li>
            <br>
            <li>You will see no sales being done here, nor will you see affiliate links or links I make money off of.</li> 
            <br>
            <li>I do not need to make money to share what I know with others as long as others are OK with free website skills.</li> 
            <br>
          </ul>
          
          <li>All lessons learned will be shared.</li>
          <br>
          <li>All data collected will be charted and presented. </li>
          <br>
          <li>Alongside results will be photos, ***videos (DaVinci-BlackMagic), ***charts (excel templates site) and what ever else we feel important that will make it easy for others to succeed in ***a garden (planning cheat sheet), ***a greenhouse (greenhouse blueprints), or to start their own ***agri-business ***growing food (show basement microgreens production video).</li>

        <h3>
            Customers and Delivery:
        </h3>
    
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Many grocers around here accept locally grown foods, we plan to hit a niche market that is pretty dead locked on its prices and quite simply everyone eats. Ever further still, fresh and local is a chiice people rather make especially if it is not more money like most organic... I cant figure out why "organic" has come to meam "more expensive".</li>
        <br>
        <li>Since we will be able to sell at a much lower rate than what it costs to plant, grow, be picked, get trucked, be stored, then shipped 10,000km, stored again in seacans in a shipyard, then trucked again to a warehouse,  from the warehouse - trucked again to stocks in your store and then to the grocery shelves. That is alot of steps to the local store. Anything grown locally and for only the costs of labour and local shipping has got to be less expensive than what it takes to do the same farm labour add all those steps in between going to the same store that for me is max a couple hundred kilometers away.</li>
        <br>
        <li>There are also Farmers Markets as an alternative.</li>
        <br>
        <li>As a last resort, a highway stand or parkinglot thing are options.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Finally, our on line presences. I plan to do a fair bit of marketing once I am able to hire a marketer. As well as get an app built for home delivery, or on site specific pickup.</li> 
        <br>
        <li>The ultimate end goal would be to have as much automated as possible as well as having some sort of drone delivery that enables from farm to fork implementation and a person wouldn't even have to leave their house.</li>

    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>All of our tropical / subtropical foods ***travels about 10,000 km or more to reach Canada.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Most freight croses the ocean to get here making the most economical transport a ***massive container ship. These ships burn ***immense volumes of fuel. For a 100,000 ***TEU (20 foot equivalent units. Meaning 100,000 20foot seacans can fit on one vessel) burns _______***tons of fuel. One ton equals ____*** number of liters.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Food costs in remote regions like ***Northwest Territories or ***Nunuvit are enormous, any food production system that allows food to be grown further north may be able to mitigate their food cost burden greatly, if this design is proven useful here.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Drake *** Landing in Alberta shows the potential of solar thermal storage.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Water can be pumped up hill for free with a ***ram pump allowing for some areas to take advantage of hills to collect water and pump it to a greenhouse for zero pennies a liter.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Mutart *** Conservatory showcases a variety of plants being growth under glass year round in Edmonton. Further highlighting the reality of the incredible variety of plants that can be grown this far north.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Soil Companies like ***Gaia and ***Fox Farms exist which pre mix very useful soil combinations making soil purchase easy. *** Subcools super soil is another way to learn how to make your own if you desire.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Greenhouses in ***Holland show that it is not far out idea to do massive production indoors.</li> 
        <br>
        <li>Verticle ***Farms show that you can go up alot and with the massive reduction of weight gained by ETFE, one can now habg alot of plants off of the building structure without need for heavier engineering in the building design.</li>
        <br>

        There is much to learn in order to grow a bountiful garden easily, with no headaches.
        </p>

        Doing it extraordinary requires dedication to observe closely plants and general life of your garden and to take measurements periodically and then to slowly adjust over some years.

        <p>
        To do that one should understand most of the following topics:

        Soil and plant production:
        </h2>
         
        <p>
            Where does plant health come from?
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Some say it comes from <a href="https://byjus.com/biology/fertilizers/#:~:text=Fertilisers%20are%20mainly%20classified%20into,types%2C%20organic%20and%20inorganic%20fertilisers." target=""blank"> fertilizer </a> while others say the <a href="https://www.cannagardening.com/inert_substrates_general_info#:~:text=The%20substrate%2C%20or%20growing%20medium,%2Dto%2Dwaste%20and%20recirculation." target=""blank"> soil </a>. 
            
            <br>
            In a way, both are correct however, fertilizer is simply nutrients extracted from something else and nutrients can be extracted from soil by <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/introduction-to-microbiology/0/steps/51408#:~:text=Current%20estimates%20suggest%20there%20could,Archaea%2C%20Fungi%2C%20and%20Protists." target=""blank"> microorganisms</a> like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode" target=""blank"> nemotodes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa" target=""blank"> protozoa</a>, and the <a href="https://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/SAG-16" target=""blank">likes </a>(This is very imprtant information for understanding soil Microbes and Nutrient Recycling, from Ohio State University). 
          </p>
          
          <p>
          This type of soil has many names; <a href="https://lomi.com/blogs/news/what-is-living-soil?nbt=nb%3Aadwords%3Ax%3A20199478977%3A%3A&nb_adtype=&nb_kwd=&nb_ti=&nb_mi=&nb_pc=&nb_pi=&nb_ppi=&nb_placement=&nb_si={sourceid}&nb_li_ms=&nb_lp_ms=&nb_fii=&nb_ap=&nb_mt=&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYjQgd6OgAMVyQetBh1aUwFZEAMYASAAEgKy7vD_BwE&campaignid=20199478977&adgroupid=&targetid=&creative=&network=x&device=c&utm_source=google" target=""blank"> Living </a> Soil, Veganic Soil, <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/subcools-super-soil-step-by-step/" target=""blank"> Supersoil </a>, <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/biodiversity/mycorrhizal-fungi" target=""blank"> Mycorrhizal Fungi (IMPORTANT) </a> and Soil, Substrate, <a href="https://www.hgtv.com/outdoors/gardens/planting-and-maintenance/how-to-amend-garden-soil" target=""blank"> Amended Soil </a>, among some names. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In a way the soil is fertilizer because the plants health comes from the fact that the soil is digested by microbe life and the dirt it self is the food for that life.
            <br>
            Intrestingly enough, most soils that are producing poorly are not in need of amending but instead just in need of having microbe life revitalized. 
          <br>

          I have discovered have some very impactful things while experimenting last year. More testing is needed, but if those results are accurate, ... my oh my ... what a potential to the future of food production that will be!

       <h3>
        Why am I the one for the job?
        </h3>
        
       <p>
       Because in the past, before it was legal, without a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_to_Cannabis_for_Medical_Purposes_Regulations#:~:text=Medical%20cannabis%20was%20first%20legalized,medical%20purposes%20would%20be%20permitted." target=""blank">MMAR</a> to grow cannabis, growing it was always a competition and challenge to see who could make the best tasting buds that got you the most baked. When I discovered <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/subcools-super-soil-step-by-step/" target=""blank">SubCool's Soil</a> Recipe, I was hooked. 
       </p>
       
       <p>
       It was a chance I am glad I took because I discovered how much soil life matters is equally important to what that soil life is processing.
       </p>
       
<hr>
       
    <h3>
      What I have learnt to date:
    </h3>
      
      <ol>
       <li>
        Nutrients (fertilizers) are equal to amendments in these setups. What certain amendments do to the quality of plants is beyond comprehension. 
       </li>
       <br>
       <li>
         Plants grow quickly once life is in the soil.</li>
        <br>
        <li>They are immune to windy days.</li> 
        
        <li>They no longer need supports for heavy fruit. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Fruit growth is maximized, something that makes harvest time a true joy to see.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Veganic soil makes plants immune to frosts also. I have had hot pepeers see a half dozen frosts with soil life and still have leaves and the actual peppers be firm and not drooping afterwards. Then we tried it with tomatoes and same thing. Frost no longer ruins the plant the first time as half dozen is the number that plants survive too. Sadly the fruit of the tomatoes were only 25% good. But that is better than losing it all, which is what typocally happens on the first or second frost.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Overwatering is not an issue. We had a month where it rained over 600 mm, which is almost a years worth, and our plants still thrived during it.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Underwatering is something I know doesn't matter thanks to indoor growing. Fortunately so far I have not dealt with droughts outside since starting these tests in the garden.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
         This type of gardening has potential to offer real problem solving solutions to growers of any kind. </li>
        <br>
        <li>
       Personally knowing the results of subcool's veganics mix on cannabis for over 10 years along side the last few years of bringing those ideas to the garden tell me that food production can benefit commercially in ways that can impact costs dramatically.</li>
       <br>
       <li>Why? because cannabis buds are technically flowers, which is the part that fruits on edible plants.</li>

        *** re edit this section***
        <p>
        The reality is that doing things the way we did for so long was simply because there was no other way to do so.That is now in the past and we find ourselves in an era where technology and creative processes can actually impact how things are done significantly. 
        <p>
          
        </p>We stand on the edge of a two way choice, keep up how we do things and stay tied to a life time of careers, inflation and potential for failire or do we allow the future in to help make our lives easier?

          Sustainable Food Production - What that means to us:
        </h2>
        
    <p>
        Truely sustainable food growth practices are one's that consider all future energy costs that come from the grid. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        From concept, one must take the time to plan how to mitigate all future cost rises. Energy is essential to production. So this is important. Because the price of energy has always shown us increase over the years, and rarely decrease. To cope we must adapt how things are done to curb the longterm impact this has on food costs. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Most importantly,as of yet there are no real solutions being suggested that solve energy. Looking at Ukraine recently shows us this proof. This is why a whole section is included below with well researched alternatives.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Finally, there are countless ideas of what sustainability should look like however, they often fall short and rarely take into account going off grid the as a posibility.

            Overall Company Goals and Objectives:
        </h2> 
        
        <p>
         -To bring warm climate food growth out of the south and into regions that are normally thought of as seasonal only.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         -To create multiple food systems that feed people in many different situations according to location. 
         <br>
         Whether you are in the country, the city, an old warehouse, or remotely located these systems provide food with very minimal:
         <ul>
             <li>Costs from grid inputs like gas and electricity</li> 
             <li>Costs to dispose of wastes that can not be recycled</li>
             <li>Cost loss due to deficencies during plant growth</li>
         </ul>
         </p>
         
     <p>
         These systems work together to provide comprehensive food growth of many varieties within many regions internationally. I am not just trying to grow the hard to grow citrus and produce like listed above, but also provide ways to raise eggs, milk, chickens, fish, and a mix of other plant products such as spices and unique root veggies are all no longer dependant on grow location. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
         -To integrate already standard production practicies together with technology and data to increase production, reduce chemical usage, reduce or eliminate wastes, and use nature as an example in order to promote plant health, vitality and growth longevity.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         -Show how easy it is to revive soils with simple practicies as well as to show the progression of life revitalization in soil with microscope pictures and video.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         -Utilize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LFvL_iYVaY" target=""blank"> sybiotic relationships  </a> between plants to provide nutrients from soil food web microbes to improve plant production and produce quality without adding fertilizers, pesticides, herbacides or any chemicals at all. (Link is to Nature of Things Video with David Suzuki about roots of forest plants and how they talk to each other and share resources.)
         </p>
         
         <p>
         -Take what we learn with the first two aspects of this food system to show the potential of the other, much larger research and development system which is a way to produce food completly off grid with no feedstocks, no energy input at all from any grid source at all.
