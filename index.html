  <h1>
    WELCOME:
  </h1>

    This is a wake up call to all of us! Food maters greatly and too many people are going around hungry in life. 
    <br>
    <br>
    We may have made mistakes in the past with how things were grown. We certainly keep hearing more and more about that today then ever before. 
    <br>
    <br>
    All their words are always scary. 
    <br>
    The truth is that it doesn't have to be.
    <br>
    <br>
    This site provides <u>real</u> solutions to <u>real</u> problems in food production. I also suggest other ways of sustainability to compliment food production and your life.

  <h3>
    Hunger:
  </h3>
  
  They say that something like a billion people on Earth are hungry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Does that sound insane to you?
  <br>
  <br>
  It sure does to me!
  
  <p>
    No person should ever be hungry, not ever! 
       <br>
  Especially when food can be grown for free.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Extra costs that local mitigates:
  </h3>
  
    <ul>
     <b> Most produce costs:</b>
      <li>labour at warehouses outside of local region and at shipyards (x2)</li>
      <li>transportation outside of (coming to) the local region</li>
      <li>all that cold storage costs are extra outside local area</li> 
      <br>
      and
      <li>the fuel to drive all forklifts, trucks and ships as well as the resources associated to build all of it</li>
    </ul>
  <p> 
    <b>For most greenhouses add the following costs and remove the above costs:</b>
  </p>
      <ul>
        <li>power</li>
        <li>gas (or electric heat)</li>
        <li>yearly shutdown and startup = many unproductive months</li>
        <li>daytime cooling</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>fertilizer or renewing soil</li>
        <li>pesticides when needed are usually needed for the whole place = $$$</li>
        <li>others</li>
      </ul>
      
  <p>
    Fortunately almost all of these costs can be eliminated with a Strategic Greenhouse Systems design.
      
<hr>
    
  <h3>
    Worldwide motivating factors:
  </h3>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Floods do not affect a greenhouse like they do open field crops.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Children and people are starving. To help, food needs to be able to make it through extremes of weather and to grow for more months a year.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Insurance costs go up with catastrophic damage which further creates more costs for our food.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Food waste average in Canada is huge - over 60% farm to fork. Most of this waste, 90%, happens before the grocery store shelves - which means between farm and outside local is where most waste happens. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In other words, long distance transportation is the leading cause of wasted food. 
      <br>
      <br>
      If true then changing to regional production, or even in country production would reduce food waste by as much as 90%.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Don't forget the costs of energy keeps going up. We intend to mitigate that problem completely with on site energy production fueled by the wastes we create.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Temperature fluxuations and unpredictable weather are decimating food randomly. Some years are bad, others not so much. We need a way around this.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>In holland they have huge areas that are greenhouses. Some areas it goes on for many square kilometers. So it not insane to think we can bring home close to year round growth and make a diffeence.
      <br>
      <br>
      The cost to maintain insurance and endure random crop losses is mitigated by indoor growth.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Plant health is better becasue of UV light. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304423818300967" target="blank"> UV light </a>is mostly blocked by typical greenhouse glazings.*** EFTE does not block it, ETFE is self cleaning, super light, and never fades. This is according to Japanese gardeners who have had ETFE on their greenhouses for over 30 + years now, with no fade or deterioration at all.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>A man in Nebraska grows oranges year round for 50 cents a day and that is it. He keeps the ambient temperature well over 20C year round and does so by blowing air into tubes that go out into his yard and collect ground temp and bring it back in (on cold days). On hot days he collects the hot air and blows it through the same tubes which is now cooler and that cools the greenhouse while capturing that extra heat into the ground for later use.</li>
 
      
    </ul>
  That was just a quick overview of everything, my intentions, some of the why and how.

 <h2>
    How many ways can food be grown sustainably?
  </h2>
  
  <h3>
    Breif overview of projects:
  </h3>
  
  
  <h4>Project 1</h4> 
  This greenhouse will prove soil science plus that chosen glazing is adequate and does as expected. That the automations are efficent and accurate as well. Design is for producing food in diverse applications and can be built almost any where there is southerly sun exposure. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Even though many examples exist for subtropical and tropical plant growth locally we are proving that food can be grown this far north too. And that we can do so for much more of the year. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We are showing soil revitalization techniques as well as how that soil life looks like under microscope. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We are studying and measuring the long term effects of soil life on food growth and if it is as viable as discovered so far. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We are showcasing energy cost savings due to design.
  <br>
  <br>
  We will document inside hourly temperatures records as well as recording residual in ground temperatures and heat gain over the years. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We hope to integrate auto watering based on a sensor array to effectively use water. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We hope to design and test farm to fork drone delivery systems after 5 years. 
  <br>
  Among other things.
  <br>
  <br>
<hr>

  <h4>Project 2</h4>
  Creates an inportant feed stream for the closed-loop production facility (project 3). This step is required along side the greenhouse in order to make Chilopoda Farms 98% viable. 
  <br>
  <br>Project 2 (C&C Farms) is a turn-key type operation that irons out all the kinks of automated milk and egg production, storing and logistics to retail. 
  <br>
  <br>We integrate into retail and iron out all the bugs before the customer takes over so customers walk into a well oiled, already funtioning, already established business so that they can become farmer with minimal training and almost guaranteed no failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Designed for both new customers or those trying to expand their operations in a sustainable way.  
  <br>
  <br>
  Fully automatic logistics dispatching, automatic animal husbandry, automatic product collection, automatic harvesting, auto packaging and storage, auto rotation of animal paddocks outside, automatic everything that can be. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The goal is to produce eggs and milk regionally at hundreds of mini farms closer to large  urban centers, collect it, pasteurize it and package it all centrally to be locally distributed.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is to reduce shipping impact costs as well as to confirm a couple aspects for the next project. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We intend to pay for the first farm and the next two with the first one. When that is done we give away the first one like habitat for humanity does. The next two are now paid for so we run those two until they pay for four more (or two more each). 
  <br>
  We give #2 and #3 away keeping 4,5,6 and 7 until they pay for two more each. When those 8 are paid we give the 4 away leaving 8 to pay for 16, when done we give the 8 away. Then 16 pays for 32 and we give the 16 away. 32 pays for 64 and we give away 32... and so on and so forth until hundreds exist around multiple cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  This way we never lose money and promote farming all in one move. 
  <br>
  <br>
  This gives skep<>tical individuals a reason to produce food as it is already established and allows them to do so without debt which is another cause of food inflation. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Design is for within 100-200km of city centers. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The average jersey cow produces about 30 liters a day. This means that 50 cows produce about 1500 liters a day. That is about 547,000 liters a year = 273,750 2L containers of milk or 136,875 @ 4 liters each. 
  <br>
  That equals $1,231,875 and $821,250 respectively (at store price). 
  Of course you don't get that as a farmer but the point is that cow milk has a very large rate of return which maximizes rate at which a farm can be paid off. 
  <br>
  <br>
  This is what makes this idea work. The ability to pay off the whole thing with minimal labour so that it can benifit other families or people who want to work on a farm. We will also provide training so that being uneducated is not a barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  R and D part is required to make the milk and egg collection area modular for easy drop and if things don't work out at that site, it is not a complete loss, just remove the buildings and bring them to a new site.
  <br>
<hr>
  
  <h4>Project 3</h4> 
  Closed-loop food production facility, as described above. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Major R and D to iron out the bugs that are expected when putting several processes together. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We are designing this for franchise type implementation. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Supported by projects #1 and #2. This is project #2s urban counterpart and can be fitter to old warehouses, malls, or old store fronts. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Each facility is closer to the mouths it feeds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deliverable prodcts planned are chickens, fish, produce, composts, animal feeds, and its own energy from ***bio digesting (german garbage trucks) its own waste to produce methane or ethane that is then used to fuel a ***cogeneration plant.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <a href="./Cogeneration.html">Cogeneration</a> will be used to provide heating and cooling for food storage, CO2 is directed to the plants to boost their growth and electricity is produced in a 90+% efficient cummins powerplant design.
  <br>
  <br>
  This will be owned by those who build it and help work out the kinks to get it running smooth at each location. We are parting with 70-80% of the shares to employees. This is to maintain the agreement with cows and chickens, as they compliment each other.
  <br>
  <br>
      In fact, this has the potenial to produce extra energy its self... 
    
  <p>
    Again, thos is a closed-loop system to produce food. Nothing will be coming into the building at all. 
    <br>
    <br>
    My research is based upon various literature and resources that show specific stages of this design but seperatly in shorter processes.
    </p>
    
    I have combined several already practices creating a chain that, if the literature is accurate, allows us to produce food, electricity and its own feed stocks as well. It starts very simply as well (trade secret for now). 
    <br>
    <br>
    Furthermore, the wastes are mitigated by internal processes creating two or three useful and saleable products (depending on what kind of processing is set up). 
    <br>
    <br>
<hr>
    
    <h4>Project 4</h4> 
    Create all needed energy on site. 
    <br>
    <br>
    We intend to test several designs of energy storage and generation north of Edmonton (for viability). 
    <br>
    <br>
    Solar may make sense in the summer here but it certainly doesn't make sense in the winter when there is only 5 or 6 hours of decent sunlight a day. The rest is night.
