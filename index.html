  <h1>
    WELCOME:
  </h1>

    This is a wake up call! Food matters greatly yet ***people frequently get hungry. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In the past we may have made mistakes in the fields. We certainly ***hear about it today more then ever before in history.
    <br>
    <br>
    Their words are usually ***scary. 
    <br>
    Good news is that it ***really isn't that bad... :)
    <br>
    <br>
    This site suggests many <i>useful</i> solutions to the ***problems within food production. Our deepest hope is that one day we will all live in a society where no one gets hungry unless they are fasting. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Reality is that we really can feed more people, in more areas, for less money.
    
<hr>
    
  <h3>
    Values:
  </h3>
    
  <ul>  
    <li>Truth maters - no matter the cost.</li> 
    <li>My heart is what leads me, my mind is what guides me.</li> 
    <li>Our children are our future, fruit and vegetables are their source of health.</li>
    <li>Earth is our home, we must care for her.</li> 
    <li>Honor - Loyalty - Care.  are equals above all else.</li>
    <br>
    <br>
    These ARE the foundations of life. They make life worth it in the end.
  </ul>
  
<hr>
  
  <h3>
    Hunger:
  </h3>
  
  Did you know that something like a ***billion people go hungry every day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doen't that sound insane to you?
  <br>
  <br>
  'cause it sure does to me!
  
  <p>
    People should never be hungry! 
       <br>
  Especially when food ***grows for free, it is only the labour, storage, resources, and transport that we pay for.
  </p>
  
<hr>
  
  <h3>
    Extra costs that growing locally mitigates:
  </h3>
  
    <ul>
      <b>Avoidable costs:</b>
      <br>
      <li>***Labour, ***refrigeration and ***energy at various ***warehouses outside of the local region, province, state and country, including ***loading and un loading at the ***shipyards.</li>
      <li>***Trucking between those warehouses and shipyards.</li>
      <br>
      and
      <br>
      <li>***Fuel required to drive all the trucks and ***equipment for loading and off loading, as well as the ***natural resources associated with building ships, equipment, ***containers, ***roads, ***etc.</li>
      <li>Using the resources we use locally and within a ***Country make sense because we need to get food to people's mouths from where it is grown, there's no doubt about that. However, the rest of it, for the most part is very unnecessary and <i>is</i> what adds significant costs to food when we are shopping at our local grocery store.</li>
    </ul>
    
  Growing locally in greenhouses isn't much better either. Even though they don't have the above costs most greenhouses have other costs like:
      <ul>
        <li>Power.</li>
        <li>Gas (unless electric heat).</li>
        <li>Production gap to shutdown and startup seasonally = many unproductive months.</li>
        <li>Daytime cooling.</li>
        <li>Nighttime heating.</li>
        <li>Water.</li>
        <li>Fertilizer and renewing soil.</li>
        <li>Pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers,etc. When these are needed it is usually the whole room. Greenhouses are huge grow rooms. This = $$$ to knock down pests, moulds, etc., if or whenever it arises.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      These are huge costs as you can see ***here on page .
      
  <p>
    Fortunately these are all removable costs with the right approach to greenhouse design. Please see project 1 below.
      
<hr>
    
  <h3>
    Motivating factors:
  </h3>
  
    <ul>
      <li>I have been hungry before, it is not fun.</li>
      <li>I have seen ***hunger. This is worse.</li>
      <li>Experimentation ***growing cannabis led me to try those same techniques on food. I was awe struck at the results. So I am sharing. I hope to start a business growing food this way. If not, at least information is on the <i>big bad web</i> for everyone to see... lol;)</li>
      <br>
      Also:
      <br>
      <li>***Floods do not affect a ***greenhouse like they do an open field.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>***Produce (healthy food) needs to be affordable to all people, all year, not just on grocery week.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Insurance costs go up after catastrophic loses further creatimg more costs.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>***Food waste average in Canada is huge - over 60% from farm to fork. Most of this waste, about 90%, happens before the grocery store shelves. Meaning that between the farm (in a warm climate) and outside our local grocer (warehouse located close by) is where most waste occurs. It is a long journey with mamy stops along the way. The fewer stops there are, and the less number of days in transport (up to a ***week or more), the better the food will hold up which will result in more ending up at the store and less cost going in your belly. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In other words, long distance transportation is the leading cause to food waste. 
      <br>
      <br>
      If those numbers are accurate then regional food production, or even in country food production would greatly reduce waste by as much as 90%, maybe more.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Nevermind that the cost of energy constantly goes.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>***Holland greenhouses are massive. Some areas it goes on for ***many kilometers. It is not insane to think that we can grow copius amounts of food under glass.
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Plant health is better becasue of UV light. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304423818300967" target="blank"> UV light. </a> UV is typical blocked with traditional greenhouse glazings.*** EFTE lets most UV through. ETFE is self cleaning, super light weighing 1/100th the weight of glass, and it never fades according to Japanese gardeners who have used ETFE on their greenhouses for over 30 years.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>A man in Nebraska grows Citrus year round for 50 cents a day. ***He mamages to keeps temperatures well over 20C all year and he does so by simply blowing air into weaping tile that collect residual thermal heat from in ground around his yard. See project 1 below for my version.</li>

  <h3>
    A deeper dive into proposed projects:
  </h3>
  
  
  <h4>Project 1</h4> 
  As seen above, maintaining enough temperature inside a building is easy if approached correctly. Below are improvments to the above ideas thar will combine to create a more than adequate growing situation for many warm climate foods and for year round plant growth in a greenhouse.
  <br>
  <br>
  This greenhouse will show soil lifes potential plus we will test the chosen glazing is adequate and does as expected. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Experiment with automation to improve efficentcy and save on resources. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Design is to produce food in diverse conditions, it can be built almost anywhere that there is a southerly sun exposure and some type of water source. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Even though many good examples of growing southerly plants exists ***locally, we are combining ***thermal batteries, glazing, ***living soil, ***automation, and ***building design together, this will allow us to grow delicious food that thrives far north of the usual. We hope to produce year-round. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Research soil revitalization techniques as well as what that soil life looks like under a microscope so others can know what they are looking for. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Study the long term effects of soil life on food growth, posting results online. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Hourly temperatures records database will be kept for yearly temperature trends and for ***residual ground heat to see if it climbs. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Design, test and implement farm to fork drone delivery system and app within 5 years. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Use ***GHAT design to promote more heat storage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Generate energy onsite with stoage capacity to help mitigate power costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Use lighting to supplement winter sun, if needed.
  
<hr>

  <h4>Project 2</h4>
  Creates an important feed stream for Chilopoda Farms facility (project 3). 
  <br>
  <br>
  This step complements the greenhouse by showing viability of future projects. 
  <br>
  <br>
  This is called C&C Farms. It is a turn-key type operation that uses automated milking and egg collection systems as well as automated storage, automated logistic dispatching and automated paddock rotation. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We run ot for a few years to work out the kinks balancing heard and flock size to the food growing capacity of the land for a given number of acres. 
  <br>
  <br>
    This research phase will allow us to pay off the equipment and farm and then pay for two more locations. R & D phase  is to fine tune the systems with the land and animals compared to customer needs.
  <br>
  <br>
  This gives our customers a well oiled, already funtioning, established business so that they can become farmer with minimal training in a turn key sort of set up. Giveing comfort to clients who want to invest in farming but aren't sure because ________. This way they will know they have a solid business to take responsibility of and not stumble.
  <br>
  <br>.  
  Milk and eggs are collected in bulk in the outlying areas, they are brought to a pasteurizer and packaging facility it the city then products are shiped to local retailer.
    <br>
    <br>
    We hope to produce most milk locally this way, within 100 - 200 km from urban populations. The intent is to reduce costs by removing some of the long distance logistics costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since this design (C&C Farms) is ballanced with Chilopoda Farms, input costs are significantly reduced because feed is grown around the paddocks and cow manure clean up is taken care of by the chickens. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Apperently ***methane is significantly reduced by feeding cows a certain type of seaweed supliment. This is one thing that can be grown in the next project facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  Water is from any of, or all of the following; drilled well, river source, land and roof collcted and stored, or city water. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Heat is from electricity and supply same as the greenhouse, on site or close by.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first farm pays for the next two farms. When that is done we give away the first one like a habitat for humanity house. The next two are now paid for in full so we run those two until they pay for two more each = four. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Every location pays for two more.
  <br>
  <br>
  We give 70% of shares to the client and keep a portion so we can keep relationship between C&C Farms and Chilopoda Farms going indefinitely.
  <br>
  <br>
   Now #2 and #3 are released keeping 4,5,6 and 7. When they pay for two more each = 8, we give the previous 4 away. The 8 pay for 16 we give 8 away. 16 pays for 32, we give 16 away. 32 pays for 64 we give away 32. 64 builds 128 then 256, 512, 1024 and so on and so forth until there are no cities up north long distance shipping milk.
  <br>
  <br>
  We brand all containers the same no matter the location so people know by the brand name that it is all sourced locally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Side note:
  <br>
  Jersey cows (milk cows) produce ***30 liters a day max. This means that 50 cows produce about 1500 liters a day max. Which is about 547,000 liters a year. Even with typical loses or shortages we stand to sell minimum 350,000 liters per quarter section or section.
  <br>
  <br>
  R and D is required to make the milk and egg collection buildings modular. If things don't work out in a particular area we simply remove the facility and truck it to a new location. It is also to figure out how many cows can be supprted on x# of acres and how many ***chickens it takes to keep the cow manure spread out and not damage the. land
  <br>
  <br>
  
<hr>
  
  <h4>Project 3</h4> 
  Chilopoda Farms food facility. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Major R and D project needing multiple professions and trades. We are combining several different processes together to produce food in a closed-loop facilty. 
  <br>
  <br>
  This is also a franchise type implementation and ownership structure as C&C Farms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of this is able to work with projects #1 and #2. However this project needs C&C Farms to supply chickens and chicken feed. Once fine tuned they can be put into an old warehouse, mall, an unused store front or  high-rise to utilize unused buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  All food sources closer to the mouths they feed are cheaper and this is an in city design, as close as one can get to the mouths it feeds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Planned eliverable are broilers (meat chickens) and laying hens, a few species fish, various plants, 3 types of compost, two animal feeds, AND its own energy that is fueled from ***bio digestion (german garbage trucks) producing methane or ethane gas that is then used to fuel a cogeneration plant.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <a href="./Cogeneration.html">Cogeneration</a> provides heating and cooling, CO2 to ***boost plant growth, and electricity. The energy produced is 90+% efficient thanks to ***Cummins Cogeneration technology.
  <br>
  <br>
    Any extra energy will be given to the grid for free or for minimal costs.
    
  <p>
    Closed-loop means that nothing will be coming into the facility at all. 
    <br>
    <br>
    My research is based upon literature that shows smaller stages of this design working very well.
    </p>
  
    Wastes are mitigated by composting, by feeding other products, and by bio-digestion to fuel power genration. 
    <br>
   
<hr>
    
    <h4>Project 4</h4> 
    Create needed energy on site. 
    <br>
    <br>
    ***Sustainability is acheived by removing uncontrollable costs. Utilities are exactly that. Being truly sustainable actually means going off-grid.
    <br>
    <br>
    We intend to test several designs of energy storage and energy generation for feasibility north of Edmonton. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Solar may make sense in the summer or down south. It certainly doesn't make sense here where there is only 5 to 6 hours of sunlight a day.

<h3>
  Summary:
</h3>

<p>
  Combined, these projects are able to bring food production closer to our grocery stores. As you can see with strategy and technology combined we can reduce many costs, costs that were historically necessary for us to enjoy certain foods year round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Never before have we had this combination of technologies available to us. The ability for us to ***automate and ***monitor our gardens remotely is unparalleled thanks to COVID. Allowing individuals more freedom while reducing costs of labour and resources. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Additionally, well tested ***FTEF is available to glaze our greenhouses. At 1/100th the weight of glass we are able to build the greenhouse normally, as if it had to hold up all that glass and then use the ultra-light*** ETFE instead giving us immemse weight supporting potential. In turn we support rows of automated verticle rotation gaden systems from the roof structure. Doing this will also give room for an extra row of food production in the ground. Combined we can maximize quantity of food produced with free sunlight in the same space as a normal greenhouse.
    <br>
    <br>
    The ability to produce food constantly means few months, if any, are spent not growing food for the market. This increases year end production significantly because 6 months aren't shut down for winter. Then we seed in the spring and have to wait several months to reap the benifits meaning that 9 months a year are not producing unless you use energy. Furthermore, planting rotationally will provide a consistent food source locally.
    <br>
    <br>
    On land water collection in hilly areas can save water and provide it for winter useage for the cost of pumping it.
    <br>
    <br>
    By allowing UV light in we have a naturally stabilized and sanitized grow environment.  Plants are able to protect themselves outside better for this reason and this is typically why infestations and other issues hit greenhouses in the first place. 
    <br>
    As we know with LEDs, better light means better plants. ***UV light is a natural sterilizer, this keeps our water sterilized which we ***oxygenate it to ensure optimal root zone health. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Living soil allows the roots to do what they are designed to do, support the plant. In nature this is automatic. Sadly for years we knew very little as to why this is the case. We now know that the roots ***communicate through ***mycelium
    <br>
     They are able to warn other plants of disease and selectively grow their roots or not to allow better chance for other plants to take hold. 
     <br>
     <br>Roots send signals to microbes and through a complicated chain of interactions involving ***Humic and Fulvic acids, nutrints and water are express delivered through root membranes and into the plant. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Microbes breakdown dirt transforming unusable nutrients and minerals into everything a plant needs to defend it self, feed it self, and keep itself healthy. 
     <br>
     <br>
     With all things combined, living soil is by far the most benifical. Although rhe magic truly happens when a person combines all these things together.
     <br>
     <br>
     Removing long distance shipping costs as much as possible is important in reducing food prices as much as it is at reducing resource damand enough to matter. Groceries account for more of our monthly purchase budget than almost any other item we buy in stores combined. It is massive to feed a family for a year. Being able to grow plants with no worries for super cheap is critical for our future unless you want to ***eat bugs. I don't.
     <br>
     <br>
     Eggs and Chickens and milk are major sales items in grocery stores. Providing these closer helps the environment significantly. Creating farms that aren't in debt when a farmer starts production will greatly reduce food prices in the long run.
     <br>
     <br>
     Food systems that compliment each other are able to provide more cost savings on top of not needing external feed sources because these are purchases and that is money out thus costly food.
     <br>
     <br>
     Closed-Loop production close to the mouths that eat is clear in in its advantages.
     <br>
     <br>
     We also can go verticle in southern windows of highrises. Knock out sections of floor near the widows and build the systems between a new wall and the glass keeping most of the office space available (able to see the plants through windows if desired) while utilizing the huge area of south facing windows and the sun they get. This even helps reduce cooling costs.
     <br>
     <br>
     I cant give any more details away without hindering my own business abilities.
     <br>
     <br>
     The rest of this site is an in depth look at all that I have said. I have more support information as well as resources galore to help with many topics. Mostly foo production and energy, but also other things like website building, water pumping for free, electrical learing, free education resources, cources from major universities and colleges, addiction stuff, community stuff, and more.
