  <h3>
    Introduction:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Can we produce food sustainably? Or is that just a pipedream? 
    <br>
    I beleive if done right, we CAN actually do s in a profound way.
    <br>
    What follows throughout outlines that... and much more. 
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Hunger:
  </h3>
  
  Did you know that they say that something like a billion people are hungry on Earth.
  <br>
  Isn't that insane sounding to you? I think it is!
  
  <p>No person should ever be hungry, not ever. Especially when food grows for free.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Extra costs on our food:
  </h3>
  
    <ul>
      <li>labour</li>
      <li>transportation</li>
      <li>storage</li> 
      <li>and</li> 
      <li>retailing</li>
    </ul>
    
  <h3>
    Global motivating factors:
  </h3>
  
    <ol>
      <li>Floods do not affect a greenhouse like they do open field crops.</li>
      <li>Children and people are starving and food needs to be able to make it through extremes of weather.</li>
      <li>Insurance costs go up with catastrophic damage which further creates more costs for our foood.</li>
  <p>
    Think about how much you buy in a store. When you shop, what are you normally shopping for? Food!
  </p>
    </ol>
    
  <h3>
    Shipping:
  </h3>

      <br>
      We go to the store many more times for food then we do for furnature, clothes, dishes, vehicles, insurace, school stuff, etc. Yes some of those things cost more, thats not the point. 
      <br>
      <br>
      What I am saying is that the largest volume of products that gets moved around globally IS food. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In a month, we buy 2-3 meals a day, on average, for 30 days (hopefully). 
      <br>
      <br>
      In that same month you may buy clothes or shoes or a piece of furniture but the likely hood that you buy 10 of those things a week is not there... usually. 
      <p>
      This means that of what is shipped globally, volume wize, at least 60% of it is food, maybe more. 
      </p>
      
  <h3> 
    Food and land:
  </h3>
      
      For us in Canada, it is grown  in the South. 
      <p>
        In fact, looking at a ***map we can see that much of Earth's land mass is in the North, and the further North you go the wider and denser it gets.
        </p>
    
        Meaning that food has the most land to grow on ONLY in places that get cold enough every year to hault major plant production. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Of the land that does grow food year round, places like South America, South Africa, and South China (the bigger global producers) are either crowded with people, dense jungle (which should be protected), mountainous, not very wide East to West, or usually some combo. 
      <br>
      
  <h3>
    Shipping and inflation:
  </h3>
      
      <p>Something has to give, right? This model of ***product distribution. With ships that burn an incredible 300 tons of fuel every single day.
      </p>
      <i>Note:</i> 
      <br><i>300 tons is equal to 600,000</i> <b><u>pounds</u> of fuel</b> 
      <u>(depending on the ton you use)</u>. 
      <p>
        <b>Yes... 600,000 pounds EVERY SINGLE DAY.</b> 
        <br>
      </p>
        <br>
        AND (the nerdy part) these ships typically take 10 - 14 day long trips... one way...
      
        <br>Apperently this is the most efficient and economical way to transport cargo. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Why?</b>
        <br>
       
       Fuel tank volume vs the ships ***TEU capacity while vs the output of the chosen engine vs how much money they can make per run due because of fuel tank volume impacting shipable cargo capicity.
    
    
  <h3>
    Something to think about:
  </h3>
 
        Since anyone can see that a ten day journey means that  6 million pounds of fuel are burnt is bad thing (that is 3000 tons btw).
      <p>
          Between the 10 largest shipping corporations there are well over 30,000 ships. Not all of them burns 300 tons a day, some more, some less.
      </p>
      
        What matters is this;
          Even if these 30,000 ships only burnt through 100 tons a day on average this still means that 3 million tons are burnt every single day.
          <br>
          <br>
          Keep in mind that this is ONLY for the 10 largest commpanies globally. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>There are more!</b>
          
  <h3>
    Other things that effect our food quality and price:
  </h3>
         
      Fertilizers and pesticides are obviously absorbed by the plants a bit and some of that gets into food. That means some organic is actually yuck! Nevermind what they do to the land over the years.
      
  <h3>
    Ukraine and energy:
  </h3>
  
        After seeing the energy crisis in Ukraine, I decided to give all power not needed by the company to grow food to the grid for free. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This will help reduce local resident's energy costs too because the grid operator will not have to produce the energy them selves... 
  <p>
      Simply stated. 
      <br>We are not selling energy that is made by nature. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Not ever! 
  </p> 
  
 <h3>
   Why can we afford to be so generous?: 
  </h3>
      
      Once the equipment is paid for it doesn't matter any more. 
 
      <br>
      <br>
        Why?
      <br>
      <br>
  
      When your growing food in ways that are self supprting you are no longer worried about re occuring costs.
      
  <h3>
    Recurring costs:
  </h3>
  
      <ul>
        <li>soil recouping with</li> 
        <li>fertilizers</li>and
        <li>pest control</li> and 
        <li>water</li> and 
        <li>electricity</li> for
        <li>heating</li>and 
        <li>cooling</li> plus the 
        <li>labour costs for the time it takes to water</li> and the 
        <li>cost of the water</li>, etc.
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        All these cost listed above are enormous when added up.
      </p>
      
  <h3>
    My design:
  </h3>
      
      Our design takes care of all of that so profits can be focused on what matters, sharing what we learn openly and freely once we have what works established and recorded it will be much easier for others to want to take the cost plunge of investing so much money effort and time on the setting up and know they will not fail in the end. 
      <br>
      <br>
      After ten years of experimenting on cannabis and more recently on food, I am certain that this is not the case. I was never legally allowed to grow production quantity cannabis, it was only personal medical. I do know how many people I ended up selling it to though because it was "the best tasting weed that gets you baked as f***" is what I was told in many ways over those few years.

    
    
  <h3>
    Winter and food growth:
  </h3>
  
  Food can not grow when frozen, that is a fact. This is probably the biggest contributor to food costs, hands down. 
  <p>
  Greenhouse growing is even more expensive the further north you go. This is due to cold winters and heating costs, the longer and more bitter the winter, ie: the further north you go and the more hours of night you see increases which meams you will have to spend more to heat a greenhouse. This makes producing food year round a southern thing, that, or a very expensive thing if choosing to do so and that is because of greenhouse design. They are designed to grow many square feet of food under glass as possble and so their design is often huge rectangles, great for summer sollar gain, equally as awesome at losing heat in the night / winter. Not so good at keeping food costs down. Since the costs of energy keep on the rise, then what we have is a recipe for food poverty and there is not much government can do about that.
  </p>
  
  <hr>
  <hr>
  
  <h3>
    You did say we could do something about it though, right?
  </h3>
  
  I sure did. As I was saying... it is about design as much as it is about technology and those two equal the importance of understanding soil science and more specifically living soils and substrates. Combined, I feel that they have a potential to offer us a financially sound way of long term food production in countless regions.
  <h3>
    How many ways can food be grown sustainably?
  </h3>
  
  
    The crazy part is that I think that we can not only grow food sustainably, we can produce food in a closed loop facility that does not require inputs nor does it require power or heat from the grid at all. In fact, it produces energy it self, along side 
    <ul>
      <li>chickens-boilers and hens</li>
      <li>2 fish species, possibly more</li>
      <li>plants of various types</li>
      <li>and a few other things as well</li>
    </ul>
    
  <p>
    Again, that is closed-loop with nothing coming into the building at all (based on various literature resources that show specific stages of this design seperatly as shorter processes).
    <br>
    <br>
    I have combined several together creating a chain that, if the literature is accurate, allows us to produce food, electricity and the feed stock as well. The most serious waste is mitigated by a process that creates two or three useful products (depending on what kind of processing is set up along the chain) - one of which is used to support the process at its early stages.
  </p>
  
  This requires the first two projects to work out so that the variables are controlled to make sure feasibility is real.
  
  <h3>
    Breif overview of projects:
  </h3>
  
  
  Project 1, the greenhouse proves soil science plus that the glazing is adequate and does as expected, amd that the automations are efficent and accurate as well. This is for placing in tight situations and producing food woth diverse applications any where needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Project 2, creates an inportant feed stream for closed-loop production to make it 98% viable. Project 2 is a turn-key operation that irons out all the kinks before the customers take over and when they do it is in a way that they walk into a well oiled, already funtioning, integrated businss with retail established so that they can become farmer, or expand their operations in a sustainable way to produce eggs and milk. For rural and close to cities (within 100-200km).
  <br>
  <br>
  Project 3 is the closed-loop facility design for cookie cutter implementation. This is the Urban counterpart and can be fitter to old warehouses, etc for a diverse food production facility closer to the mouths.
  <br>
  <br>
    Project 4 is energy use mitigation, we intend to test several designs of energy storage north of Edmonton (for viability) as wel as test various production methods. Being ee are so far north, using solar may make sense in the summer but it certainly doesn't make semse in the winter when there is only 5-7 hours of sunlight daily, the rest is night. Ideas include hydrogen genration unit, fuel cells, other combinations of technology like heat engines, gravity fed turbines fed for free from ram pump,and a few more.

    Where to find out more?
  </h3>
  
  Everything I have talkd about and will mention om this page is verifiable <a href="./Home.html">here</a>. 
  <p>
    However, please keep reading to get an overview of everything, this will help when searching through my site.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    I'm confused, do you mean to say that we can eat food for free?
  </h3>
    
  
  <p>
  <i>That</i>, my good friend, is an excellent question.
  </p>

  <p>
    Will food ever cost less?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Maybe...
    <br>
    I mean, hopefully, if I have anything to do about it then yes. 
    <br>
    Truthfully, I don't know honestly and I am worried that this reality will be quited just like it has been for so many others. 
  </p>
  
    Here's what I do know. What I know is that we our selves are all we can trust for bringing change to our own lives. We have waited on the government for too long to do something good for us.
    <br>
    <br>
    Clearly they have their hands full trying to do other things. Which is fine. 
    <br>
  <p>
      What is not fine though is that people are hungry and food is free.
  </p>
    
  <h3> 
    City streets and hunger:
  </h3>
    
    <br>
    Think about this. If cities planted food in their boulevards, like berry and fruit bushes, and they did that for one out of every 10 trees that they planted back when they built their strees... then today there would be hundreds of thousands, probably millions of food producing trees and shrubs spread accross countless streets in various towns, villages, cities, and urban areas... what then? Don't you think that some, if not many of the millions of hungry people could be fed?
    <br>
    <br>
    Money was spent to buy those trees along the streets anyways... so why not spend it on fruit trees that can feed its citizens?!?

  <p>
      Like I was saying, clearly if we are going to get help it ain't coming from them... and no one else is stepping up to feed us as they should.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Expecting our government to help us:
  </h3>
  
  
     Sadly, it us that must take the initiative if we ever hope to see this get better.
  
  
  <h3>
    My opinion:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
  I think we can reduce the majority of our costs easily, while upholding to organic standards, ALL WHILE reducing environmental impact and demand significantly.

  Where we live:
</h1>
  
  <h3>
    Earth:
  </h3>
  
  
    Nature is beautiful, did you know? All her sounds, with birds chirping and skwaking, buzzing in the air and the air making noise as it russles the leaves. It is no wonder they say "Earth is a living planet". 
      <br>
      <br>
    It literally is. 
      <br>
      <br>
    Did you know that for as much life as there is above ground, many factors more exist below our feet in the ground? 
      <br>
      <br>
    Did you know we can sequester oodles of CO2 into the soil by simply growing plants?
      
      
  <h3>
    Living soil:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Did I say living soil? I sure did. In fact the soil is teeming with life. Some say that soil is so diverse in microbes that for every tablespoon there is billions of individual living somethings. 
      <br>
      <br>
    And all those somethings must do something right?
      <br>
      <br>
    ... to be honest, were still working on it. We can say with certainty that having soil life can greatly impact plant life positively as much as not having soil life can be not good for plants.
      <br>
      <br>
    How not good? Well that is complicated. You see I have been discovering that it is not entirely the soil life that impacts how, and what, plants contribute to their environment. 
      <br>
      <br>
    Again, with certainty I can say that no soil life means a plant is more or less defenseless. However, what I do not understand is why adding certain amendments do the things they do, both to the plant and to root zone.
      <br>
      <br>
    We will go deeper into this later. For now just know that all evidence thus far suggests that we can prevent plant most issues such as pests, fungus and the likes, as well as root issues and we can do it easily with ***myco inoculations. You see, there are billions of little guys in there and hundreds, if not thousands of types too, each with a special thing they digest, communicate, or signal back to the plant.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Plants:
  </h3>
  
  
    Yes! you read that right. There are communications happening from the plants through the roots to the microbes and back. The plants send ***exudates which can signal anything from "I am sick and need such and such", to "I am deficient in this nutrient", to "I have a pest infection send ______ to help me flush it out". Some plants even know when their own seed is present. When that happens they can kill off an area of their own roots in order to ***allow the seed best chance to germinate.
      <br>
      <br>
    Plants ***have memory and can react (like ***venus fly trap)
      to events in their environment.
  
      
  <h3>
    About microbes:
  </h3>
  
  <p> 
  
    Microbes... as I said, these are complicated. We will go much deeper into this later.
      <br>
      <br>
    Nonetheless, intresting things happen to plants with certain amendments. Some seem to make it so the roots can ***fix nitrogen better.
    <br>
    <br>
    A super useful thing is tha most plants have become super cold resilient to the point of still being edible after half dozen frosts. 
      <br>
      <br>
    They are able to take on more water than normal <b>without rood damage or stunted growth.</b> Plus they can handle droughts just as well. 
      <br>
      <br>
    They can somehow pick themselves up off the ground. In other words, plants that once lay on dirt that you normally have to watch for food rot because they no longer stay on the ground. Instead they literally grow upright! Firmly making them alao wind resistant. As in, we had a week of super winds, well over 100km/hr+++ for a few days (our weather station only registers that high), and yet our garden was fine for the most part. Other plants, outside the garden, were not so well off. Trees had many down leaves and branches... worse in some cases.
    <br>
    <br>
  What ever it is that comes to life in the soil certainly helps plants in many ways. I now know it does things that are almost to good to be true. Yet year after year I seen the same thing... 
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>
    The garden system:
  </h3>
  
  
    
    We figure we can grow many varieties of foods up north just as easy as we can down south outside. Sure it is inside, but there has to be a point where logistics and reducing climate impact matters more than how it is done and the set up costs associated with that.
      <br>
      <br>
    When one considers the impact soil science has on the outcome of plants (described above and in the <a href="./Plant Plant Care and Soil Life.html">living soil section</a>). 
  
    
  <h3> 
    My thoughts on this:
  </h3>
    
    Once I realized how many parts of a growing plant benefited from soil life being there, I started to push the plants to points of extreme that just aren't possible. When they not only survive, but thrive... it goes against all that I have ever seen while growing up.
      <br>
      <br>
    Thats when I thought... "wow... we can really do somthing good for people with this". Like really! And thats when I cooked up some of my older ideas on how to handle more situations.
  
  
<hr>
  
  <h3>
    The concepts - breif overview of planned projects:
  </h3>
  
  
    So. First project is a simple greenhouse atfirst look. But it is not simple at all.
      <br>
      <br>
    It will capture all daytime heat and store it underground in the floor of the greenhouse for redistribution when it is winter and especially those nights.
      <br>
      <br>
    This greenhouse will test soil science thoroughly north of Edmonton, not only for viability, but also for possibility of extreme north aplications.
  
  
  <h3>
    Energy. To grid or not to grid:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    We will have multiple sources of renewable energy production on site. 
      <br>
    Thermo-photo voltaic cells need sun and the sun isn't always shining so we decided on a combo with mini wind as well as a potential to utilize hydrogen fuel cells. 
      <br>
    With energy storage. Perhaps the power wall or redox-flow batteries. Or a combination of both. For those particularly long winter nights up here.
      <br>
    Energy has to be made on site to prevent impacting food costs any further. 
      <br>
    Especially as energy always goes up, not down. If current long term trends hold true then it would not be good to neglect energy consumption mitigation. 
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Glazing and structure:
  <h3>
  
  
    To benifit from natural ground warmth, the green house will be in the ground on the north side.
      <br>
      <br>
    Because the glazing target is for EFTE this will replace what is typically lexan or glass which will be significantly less weight to hold up with the structure. This will benifit us nicely as we can now create verticall systems off of the roof supports along the column isles. 
    <br>This will greatly increase our food output.
      <br>
      <br>
    Since this is an in ground greenhouse, when going from south to north inside will be uphill in teirs. This is to allow sun penetration through the rows of trees to clear the leaves so as to create equal lighting throughout while maximizing food production space. Tomatoes in the ground and above rows upon rows of strawberries in auto vertical rotation planters.
      <br>
      <br>
    To further create more layers of food production the rows of trees will all have rows of dwarf mangos and other dwarf varieties, as well as smaller plants to be plated in between trees for the rows running east west.
  <p>
    Water will be collected on the land and stored in outdoor dugouts on property. Rolling hills. Run off can easily be colllected in a water supply system, outlined later on.
