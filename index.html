            External Links:
          </h3>
 <p>
          Links to offsite sources are how we provide data. Most links are your choice to click or not.However some are <i> followed </i>by (IMPORTANT) or (Important), the first (IMPORTANT) is <u>essential knowledge</u> and you should click it, the second is necessary but will <b>also be covered </b>in the video documentary section - should you dislike reading and choose that route instead (already below).
          <br><br>
          When you see "***" these are for me to find easier so I can put links there later on when I get to a computer and <u>can be ignored</u>. 
          <br>
          <i>Links take a weekday or two to complete after weekend editing.</i>
