<h4>
  Instigating factors:
</h4>

  Food matters greatly yet <!--***-->people frequently are hungry. 
  
<hr>

<h3>
  In the news:
</h3>

    They claim that we have made mistakes in our fields. We certainly <!--***-->hear about it more today then ever before. But is that true? Are we really at a state of no return in agriculture? Or is that just another reason for them to charge us more $$$?
  <p>
    At times it may be difficult to tell because their words can be <!--***-->ominous and scarry sounding, in some ways they are believable. 
  </p>
  
  <hr>
  
  <h4>
    The truth is:
  </h4>
  
    It <!--***-->really doesn't have to be that bad. The feilds can be fixed easily. Food can be grown sustainably. Energy can be produced in more efficent ways. We can grow gardens without chemicals better than we can with chemicals. The environment doesn't have to suffer. We can produce food without waste accumulation. 
    <br>
    <br>
    It takes designs considerations combined with other technologies, sciences and techniques. The more that is considered, the better the outcome righ up to allowing us to provide food systems that grow almost year round even in the winter and snowy regions.
    <p>
    Here at Strategic Food Systems we make everything good possible.. :)

  <h3>
    Journey:
  </h3>

    On my journey of food learning I have often found that the knowledge required to grow <!--***-->veganically (pure <!--***-->vegan organics) was spread accross many websites and information types.
    <br>
    <br>
    I have siffted through oodles to accomplish what I have to date in my garden. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I observed how forests are phenomenal growth machines. A place where plants seem to be resistant to the various issues that annoy gardeners.
    <br>
    <br>
    Trying to recreate that is when I discovered how truely wonderful science is.
<hr>

<h3>
  Site contents:
</h3>

    Most of what is found on this webisite pertans to plant growth specifically, and how we can have <!--***-->food systems that work together in order to reduce grocery store costs significantly.
    <p>
    More importantly, I suggest why our food system is flawed. I exhibit plenty of evidence showing what is costing us so much. I provide details on what steps can be eliminated without changing what we eat. I show science, other peoples experiences, and my own results for support. I will illistrate ways others have used to <!--***curtis farms-->alleviate their own food costs thus providing you with solutions that can be used to create sustainable food businesses and food solutions. 
    </p>
    
    I show the science, the how to's, the why's, the designs, and the systems that can change our world from people being hungry to that never again being possible.

  <h3>
    What can plants do that I don't already know about?:
  </h3>

It is not the plants exactly. More so it is what amendments and microbes can do that is incredible.
<br>
<br>
  Growing your own food is not only thrilling. It is rewarding on many levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  But what could possibly make me make such glamorous claims?
  
  <p>
  This all started when my plants defeated a few frosts at the end of the year. I ended up with edible food after a few freezes, which is unheard of. 
  </p>
  Then my garden survived a wind storm while the rest of the yard was practically obliterated...
  <p>
    But how?
  </p>

<hr>

<h3>
  Plant super powers?:
</h3>
  
  Maybe! At first I couldn't help but wonder how much of it <i>was</i> from the changes I had made to my soil or if it's all in my head. 
  <p>
    It doesn't end there...
  </p>
  
<h4>
  To much rain. No problem!:
</h4>

  Then you remember that the last time there was a flood of rain and you lost a bunch, or almost lost everything. And that you have lost plants (food) every single time something extreme happens. 
  
  <p>

  The miracles keep happening again and again. This time I got waaay better results because I decided to really push it, just to see, you know? Thats when.

  </p>

<h4>
  Freeze resistance?:
</h4>  
  
  Whoa!!! Not only are my plants alive, I'm thinking these are zombie plants because of how many frosts they have been through. Somehow these potted green beauties are green leafed, supple and alive enough while the rest of the garden is frozen stiff. Like to the point that touching any part of a plant breaks it off. Which is normal for a frozen plant.
  
<h4>
  You said freeze resistance...:
</h4>

  These frozen plants are right beside my 'special pots', with the amendments and the sciency stuff I did to the soil. Creating soil life that I think is there but have no proof that <i>it is</i> actually <i>in there</i> even though for the third year in a row plants are doing things that plants don't normally do. Only in the sciency pots and only after they had been inoculated.
<hr>

<h3>
  Plants are usually fragile:
</h3>

  Flora (plants) don't normally survive extreme conditions. We all know this. Plants dislike; heavy rains, extreme temperatures, frost, wind bursts, hail, drought, etc. Plants also do not come back from being half - 3/4 dead. And they certainly have issues with pests at time. 
  <p>
    Typically is correct. This is not typical because amended plantsin living soil defy these known facts.
  </p>
  
<h4>
  Not just once either!:
</h4>  

  <p>
    Plants that don't freeze and are still movable as if not frozen (their leaves and stems) is an unheard of thing at -5C. It has happened twice now.
  </p>
  
    The second time they survived several frosts in a row because I was out of town? 

<h4>
  All because of soil hey?:
</h4>

  <p>
    Yes! The aformentioned events happen only becasue I amended the soil and revitalized its life. 
    </p>

<hr>


<h3>
  And then?:
</h3>

  Imagine if we took the above soil improvements and all the incredible that does and then we introduced the following peer tested improvements?:
  
  <ul>
    <li>Building design enhancments</li>
    <li>Special greenhouse technologies</li>
    <li>Automation</li>
    <li>Companion planting</li>
    <li>Symbiotic planing</li>
    <li>Consideration for what a plant provides to the soil in its life (rotational croping)</li>
    <li>Thermal battery (heat storage)</li>
    <li>Water oxygenation</li>
    <li>On site energy production and storage</li>
  </ul>

<hr>

<h3>
  From my experience:
</h3>

  
  Not only have I teated single amendments against control pots I have experimented with various combinations with and without soil microbes. I have tested the soils alongside controls throughout. Some were simole while others had more than typical. Luckily all were tested during the above extreme situations. Any pot that lacked soil life failed in all situations except drought. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Living soil can be amplified by amendments or perhaps it's the other way around, I am uncertain. I am certain that we can accomplish miracles with living soil and soil science.

<hr>
<hr>

  <h3>
    We all thought plants needs were basic:
  </h3>
  
    We used to know that they only needed the following to survive:
      <ul>
        <li>Things like energy - from the sun or lights</li>
        <li>Food - through the root system</li>
        <li>Water - from various sources</li>
        and
        <li>CO2 - From the air (what we exhale)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      We now know differently.
      </p>

<hr>

<h3>
  Rationalizing things so far:
</h3>

      
  <p>
As you can see things aren't always so simple. What we used to think was enough to keep a plant healthy was actually severly lacking. In reality, the scope of required 'things' that I am suggesting needs to be done might seem daunting. Since most of these suggestions are not typical when it comes to professional advice so I would have to agree.  
</p>

Although we can grow plants by watering them enough, making sure they have adequate sun light is critical.
<br>
<br>
That used to be it. The best part is that it doesn't take more work in the end. Simply taking a different approach at the start we will end up with results that can speak for themselves. 

<hr>
<hr>

<h3>
  Plants and soil science. What is it?:
</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Mirobes. Some people call them 'myco's' or <!-- ***-->'mycohyzzyl' they are a type of fungi (mushroom).</li>
      <br>
      <li>How to source these microbes? Compost tea, humus, compost, store bought inocculant cocktail, micro brew, etc. are all excellent sources of soil life. When we put these things in our soil we say we are 'inoculatibg it'.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Microbes need to eat something, so at first we need to give them food until they get going. For that we use sugar (de-sulfurated molasses) in water and humic acid blend and/or more inoculant / brew once a month.</li>
      <br>
      <li>As long as the root zone and the soil immediately around the plant are not disturbed the microbes will take hold and stay for significantly longer. Rototilling breaks the networks apart making them have to start all over again.
      <br>
      <li>Plants also need good water.</li>
      <br>
      <li>
      Artificial lights work but are really expensive if paying for the equipment and/or the power bill.</li>
      <br>
      <li>A person should also monitor the propogation of microbes throughout the soil with a microscope. <!--***-->see microscope section. Coming soon.</li>
    </ul>
  
<h4>
  Plants and Oxygen:
</h4>
  
  <p>  
    Did you know that <!--***-->plants require Oxygen? 
  </p>
  
  They do. Not much, but they do.
  <br>
  <br>
  In nature, it usually happens when rain falls. As raindrops fall they become concentrated with O2 (oxygenated). When a drop hits the ground it takes that trapped oxygen into the ground with it. This oxygenates the roots which helps the roots do their routine more efficiently. This adds other <!--***-->positive effects to the plant as wel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Why? Oxygen promotes the roots to help a plant process starches and sugars more efficiently. We all know how essential sugars are to photosynthesis. Photosynthesis has another waste product besides Oxygen, it's starch. Starch is mostly processed at night making this important because plants slow down at night but have a whole days worth of starch to process for the next day. 

<h4>
  One single plant breath:
</h4>

<p>
  A plant breathes once per day. 
</p>
During the day, oxygen is exchanged out the leaves while absorbing carbon dioxide. Starting the breath cycle (inhalation).

At night the roots take in Oxygen and expel CO2. Completing the full breath by exhalation.

<h4>
  Lightning has effects on the rain:
</h4>

  Lightning atomizes the air with every strike.
  <br>
  <br>
   There are studies that suggest this helps sterilize water by atomizing the atmosphere around the rain as it falls. 
   <br>
   
   <p>
     That about completes what we can do to promote better growth through the root zone. There are other things we can do but their cost is not worth doing them.
<hr>
<hr>

<h4>
  Specifically, living soil can put the following in the rearview:
</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Fertilizing.</li>
    <li>Occasional pests, moulds, etc.</li>
    <li>Root zone issues with over watering.</li>
    <li>Weather damage- wind, hail etc.</li>
    <li>Heating and cooling costs.</li>
    <li>Short seasons due to cold.</li>
    <li>Even shorter season length in Northern climates due to winter.</li>
    <li>Lost quality because of long distance shippeding.</li>
    <li>Short life of most produce after purchase.</li>
    <li>Major watering costs, in most cases.</li>
    <li>Spring and Fall growth slowdown due to temperature.</li>
    <li>Not avoidable minor costs might include tools, pots, watering equipmemt, sprayers, pruners, etc. These are typically one time purchases only.</li>
  </ul>

<hr>  

<h3>
  Plants grow for free:
</h3>
  
  The actual growing of a plant is done by the soil, the water and the sunlight. We do nothing there. We do have to plant the seeds or seedlings, we have to weed throughout the year and then we harvest. The rest, besides watering, should not cost you or I more atthe store!
  
<hr>


<h3>
  Reducing costs by catagory:
</h3>

<h4>
  Weeding:
</h4>

Time weeding is mitogated by top dressing the base of plants or using filter cloth or weed stop. You can also use cardboard to stop weeds. Cardboard eventually becomes part of the soil feeding it slightly. 
  <br>
  <br>
For the plants simply cut holes in the above weed stop materials that are slightly bigger than the trunk or stem will be. This reduces the area needing to be weeded significantly, saving many hours of time in a year. 
<br>
<br>
Another way to slow weeds down is with wood chips, shredded bark, grass clippings, or raked up yard leaves.

<h4>
  Seeding:
</h4>

You can use an <!--***-->auto seeder or a <!--***-->hand held seeder to save time.

<h4>
  Harvesting:
</h4>

<!--***-->Microgreens hand held harvester. Different <!--***Lee valley-->hand held tools. <!--***-->Automated harvesting. <!--***-->Drones.

<h4>
  Watering:
</h4>

Automated <!--***-->watering with in ground sensors and condition monotoring systems. Run an aquarium bubbler in water at all times for O2. Store water in opaque tanks that are in direct sun light for <!--***-->UV steralization.

<h4>
  Water:
</h4>

Collect rain water and snow runoff from buildings. Dehumidify water. Water wells. Land run off diversion and collection then use <!--Rampumps--> rampumps to pump water for free. Solar power and batteries pump backups.

<h4>
  Energy:
</h4>

Produce electricity on site and store it. See <!--***-->energy section for more information on this (under construction).

<h4>
  Artificial lighting for season extension:
</h4>

There is one type of HID lighting, called <!--***-->plasma lights. These beauties are super efficient. They do not have to be close to a plant like other HIDs. They cast enough light through the branches. They can hang on the roof and provide lumens through the entire depth of the branches to the ground with no need for multiple lights side by side saving immensely on power bills. Use energy generation and storage to help with the costs.

<hr>
<hr>

<h3>
  Root rot:
</h3>

<p>
Some plants can not tollerate being wet for extended periods. This is how plants get <!--Rootrot-->root rot easily and must be prevented at all costs. Thankfully living soil is amazing at preventing this except in extreme situations.
</p> 
  
  Be sure to check your plant varieties online or on an <!--extention office-->extention office website to see if your variety has any thing you should know before you plant them.
  
<hr>

<h3>
  Top dressing:
</h3>

  Top dressing helps retain moisture longer, keeps weeds down, prevents bugs, helps fertilize, protects against the hot sun drying the base of your plant out. But top dressing is sketchy at times. Check online to see if you should or should not top dress your roots.

  <p>
  *If you do, DON'T let any top dressing touch the stems of plants or tree trunks. Always keep back 3+ inches and only apply an inch or two thick.
</p>
  
<hr>
<hr>

<h3>
  To summarize thus far:
</h3>

  It turns out that growing a plant simply can end up being more work than planned.
  <br>
  <br>
Even though it seems like there are many moving parts in veganics it only sounds that way. Im the end it is more about knowing what to watch out for and reacting ahead of something becoming an issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Setting everyting up is the hardest part aside from learning. Once things get going though, it only becomes easier and more efficient the longer conditions are maintained. 
  <br>
  <br>This is why I mentioned microscope skills... they are required for knowing what you do or do not have in your soils and composts. 
  <br>
  <br>Thankfully those skills can <!--***-->easily be learnt online.

<hr>
<hr>

<h3>
  Light matters to plants:
</h3>

    Last and almsot the most important fact is the type of light a plant gets. Plants grow best in the sun, plain and simple. Indoors or outdoors, it doesn't matter. The best growth rates come from the sun, period! 

<h4>
  Artificial lights:
</h4>

    Because HID lights get way to hot indoors providing less <!--***-->lumens then the sun can naturaly. It makes sense not to use them.
    <p>
      Note: Lumens are the amount of light energy (photons) per square foot that hits a surface. More lumens equals faster and more robust growth. 
    </p>

    Lights are crazy expensive for both for the low powered option *<!--***-->LEDs (equipment and set up costs). The cheap set up version HIDs use huge amounts of <!--***-->energy (1000kwh per bulb). 
    
  <!--Show costs for lights below-->  
    <p>
    Furthermore, the bulbs only last so long and must be replaced eventually. Even for LEDs. Although LEDs are significantly longer life they still do have a maximum service time but they are many fold more expensive to replace then high pressure sodium or metal halide bulbs because you have replace more than just a bulb.
    </p>
    
<hr>

<h3>
  Enter my solution <!--***-->FETF:
</h3>

    What is FETF? It's glazing which is simply glass. This choice is crutial in the long run. 
    <p>
     <!--***-->FETF, described <!--***-->here (under construction).
    </p>
    
<!--Add link to projects page-->

<hr>
<hr>

  <h3>
    Initial set up:
  </h3>
    Like with anything, you have to purchase items to start out. Things like soil, pots, watering systems, ventilation, greenhouse structure, etc., all need purchasing anyways. Simply substitute some of the initial items for certain other ones instead and in the long run less is spent.
    <br>
    <br>
    Instead of soil buy <!--***-->pre amended <!--***-->starter soils.
    <br>
    <br>
    Instead of ventilation, heating and cooling invest in <!--***-->GHAT style greenhouse.
    <br>
    <br>
    Instead of glass buy <!--***-->FETF.
    <br>
    <br>
    Instead of pesticides, herbacides and fertilizers buy amendments for every now and then, <!--***-->neem oil or neem cake, <!--***-->mycohyzzel, powdered <!--***-->humic and fulvic acid blends, compost tea brewing equipment and sprayer, and diatomaceous earth for pest control.
    <br>
    <br>
    etc.

<hr>
  <h3>
    Breif Recap:
  </h3>
  
    With these examples of what can be accomplished we get closer to year round food growth, locally, without numerous added costs, while implementing many cost reduction strategies, with nearly zero pest issues, no need for fertilizers, to create the ability to grow most of what we desire locally closer to the mouths that eat it.
    <br>
    <br>
    Finally, we infuse renewable energy sources alongside energy storage systems to mitigate all unnecessary costs that utilities can create.
    <br>
    <br>
    We create thermal storage in the ground under the greenhouse floor to 'store' extra greenhouse heat in the dirt for use later on when it is cold.
    <br>
    <br>
    We burry half the greenhouse in the summer to trap more heat in the dirt of the north wall and to be in the ground as an extra layer of protection from the cold.
    <br>
    <br>
    We align the south windows to the winter suns highest solar angle so winter heating is maximized on the shortest days of the year.
    <br>
    <br>
    Then we use soil science (living soil) as well as various planting techniques and add them to other techniques that others have used. More on that later.


<hr>
  <h3>
    Expected outcome:
  </h3>

    The creation of resilient food production systems.
    <br>
    <br>
    Together these can have an important role in our future and for our collective food freedom. 

<hr>

  <h3>
    Summarizing:
  </h3>
  
    We all need plant foods for healthy long lives. Thankfully this can easily be accomplished through the abilities of nature alone. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This all started from observing a forest compared to a field. If you were to do so for long enough you begin to notice that a forest can cycle through layers of dead fall every year with incredible ease, while a field does not do so well in comparison.
    <br>
    <br>
    This happens because of living soil. Which actually happens becase of decomposition of previous plant materials combined with animal wastes, carcasses and more. Together they create an environment that allows a plant to be able to diversely fend (and defend) for itself effectively and successfully year after year without human inputs. No one needs to fertilize the forest to get excellent plant growth, not even once. Seeing that answers all our questions about whether or not we need fertilizers. The answer is still unraveling as we learn more. It is truly a great time to be apart of food growth with new advancements discovered every day who knows what the future will hold.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thanks to dedicated individuals throughout the years we are now able to replicate some of those same symbiotic relationships in a pot. 
    <br>
    <br>

<hr>
<hr>

  <h3>
    Mycellium:
  </h3>
  
    Further work and observation shows the importance of compost in these relationships. This has brought us to the reality that we can revitalize a field just as easily with compost tea and a sprayer as we can with fertilizer. The difference is that fertilizers have to be reapplied often. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Giving soil back its life is only required in monoculture practices. 
    <br>
    <br>
    With these new strategies in the field we are able to take some soil life and grow it over time using crop rotation and planting certain plant types. More research needed here.
   
  <hr>
  
  <h4>
    Compost tea:
  </h4>
    
    Compost tea is a brew made from a handful or two of <!--***-->good compost, placing that in a large barrel with water, some form of <!--***-->food for the microbes and letting that brew in the sun for a week or two. The result is a root innoculent that seeds soil life while vastly improving plant growth for a period of time afterwards.  
    <br>
    <br>
    Compost tea can be made cheeply, it costs significantly less than fertilizers and is sprayed just as easily using similar equipment. 
    <br>
    <br>

    We all need food for life and health:
  </h3>
  
    Our deepest hope is that one day soon we will all live in a society where no one gets hungry unless they are fasting or for some other reason choose to do be hungry.
    <br>
    <br>
    Reality is that we can feed more people, in more areas of the globe, for less cost and we can do it for almost free all year round... even in areas like Edmonton.

  Resources and shipping:
</h4>

    <ul>
      <b>Remove extra costs:</b>
      <br>
      <li><!--***-->Labour, <!--***-->refrigeration and <!--***-->energy at various <!--***-->warehouses outside of the local region, province, state and country, including <!--***-->loading and un loading at the <!--***-->shipyards.</li>
      <br>
      <li><!--***-->Trucking between those warehouses and shipyards.</li>
      <br>
      and
      <br>
      <br>
      <li><!--***-->Fuel required to drive all the trucks and <!--***-->equipment for loading and off loading, as well as the <!--***-->natural resources associated with building ships, equipment, <!--***-->containers, <!--***-->roads, <!--***-->etc.</li>
      <br>
      Using the resources we use locally and within a <!--***-->Country make sense because we need to get food to people's mouths from where it is grown, there's no doubt about that. However, the rest of it, for the most part is very unnecessary and <i>is</i> what adds significant costs to food when we are shopping at our local grocery store.
    </ul>
    
<h4>
  Typical greenhouses:
</h4>

  Growing locally in a greenhouse isn't much better either. Even though they don't have the above costs that most greenhouses have they have other costs such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Power.</li>
        <li>Gas (unless electric heat).</li>
        <li>Production gap to shutdown and startup seasonally = many unproductive months.</li>
        <li>Daytime cooling.</li>
        <li>Nighttime heating.</li>
        <li>Water.</li>
        <li>Fertilizer and renewing soil.</li>
        <li>Pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers,etc. When these are needed it is usually the whole room. Greenhouses are huge grow rooms. This = $$$ to knock down pests, moulds, etc., if or whenever it arises.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      These are huge see <!--***-->here.
      
  <p>
    Fortunately these are all removable costs with the right approach to greenhouse design. Please see project 1 below.

  <h3>
    Motivation:
  </h3>
  
    <ul>
      <li>I have been hungry before, it is not fun.</li>
      <li>I have seen ***hunger. This is worse.</li>
      <li>Experimentation <!--***-->growing cannabis led me to try those same techniques on food. I was awe struck at the results. So I am sharing. I hope to start a business growing food this way. If not, at least information is on the <i>big bad web</i> for everyone to see... lol;)</li>
      <br>
      Also:
      <br>
      <li><!--***-->Floods do not affect a <!--***-->greenhouse like they do an open field.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li><!--***-->Produce (healthy food) needs to be affordable to all people, all year, not just on grocery week.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Insurance costs go up after catastrophic loses further creatimg more costs.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li><!--***-->Food waste average in Canada is huge - over 60% from farm to fork. Most of this waste, about 90%, happens before the grocery store shelves. Meaning that between the farm (in a warm climate) and outside our local grocer (warehouse located close by) is where most waste occurs. It is a long journey with mamy stops along the way. The fewer stops there are, and the less number of days in transport (up to a <!--***-->week or more), the better the food will hold up which will result in more ending up at the store and less cost going in your belly. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In other words, long distance transportation is the leading cause to food waste. 
      <br>
      <br>
      If those numbers are accurate then regional food production, or even in country food production would greatly reduce waste by as much as 90%, maybe more.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Nevermind that the cost of energy constantly goes.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li><!--***-->Holland greenhouses are massive. Some areas it goes on for <!--***-->many kilometers. It is not insane to think that we can grow copius amounts of food under glass.
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Plant health is better becasue of UV light. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304423818300967" target="blank"> UV light. </a> UV is typical blocked with traditional greenhouse glazings. <!--***-->EFTE lets most UV through. ETFE is self cleaning, super light weighing 1/100th the weight of glass, and it never fades according to Japanese gardeners who have used <!--***-->ETFE on their greenhouses for over 30 years.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>A man in Nebraska grows Citrus year round for 50 cents a day. <!--***-->He mamages to keeps temperatures well over 20C all year and he does so by simply blowing air into weaping tile that collect residual thermal heat from in ground around his yard. See project 1 below for my version.</li>

<h3>
  Conclusion:
</h3>

Alegedly we lose up to 70% during shipping so they grow 70% more to account for those loses. This won't need to be true anymore if food is grown locally. Saving us space required to grow that same amount of food because the amount of space we will need to replace that production locally is significantly less. 50-70% less .

  Combined, these projects are able to bring food production closer to our grocery stores in several cost efficent ways. With strategy and technology combined we can reduce many costs, costs that were historically necessary for us to enjoy certain foods year round locally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Never before have we had this combination of technologies available to us. The ability for us to <!--***-->automate and <!--***-->monitor our gardens remotely is unparalleled thanks to COVID. Allowing individuals and families more freedom while reducing costs of labour and resources are certainly assets in some way.
    <br>
    <br>
    Additionally, well tested <!--***-->FTEF is available to glaze our greenhouses. At 1/100th the weight of glass we are able to build the greenhouse normally, as if it had to hold up all that glass and then use the ultra-light <!--***-->ETFE instead giving us immemse weight supporting potential. In turn we support rows of automated verticle rotation garden systems from the roof structure. Doing this will also give room for  extra rows of food in the ground underneath. Combined we can maximize food produced with free sunlight and can even be put these in normal greenhouses.
    <br>
    <br>
    The ability to produce food constantly means fewer months, if any, are spent not growing food for the market. This increases year end production significantly because 6 months aren't shut down for winter. Then seed in the spring and have to wait months to reap the benifits leaving upto 9 months a year not producing unless you use energy to spring and fall heat.
    <br>
    <br>
    On land water collection in hilly areas can save water in ponds and provide it for winter useage for the cost of pumping it.
    <br>
    <br>
    By allowing UV light in we have a naturally stabilized and sanitized grow environment.  Plants are able to protect themselves outside better for this reason and this is typically why infestations and other issues hit greenhouses in the first place, light filtration. 
    <br>
    <br>
    As we know with LEDs, better light means better plants. <!--***-->UV light is a natural sterilizer keeping our qir and water sterilized which we <!--***-->oxygenate to ensure optimal root zone health. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Living soil allows the roots to do what they are designed to do, support the plant. In nature this is automatic. Sadly for years we knew very little as to why this is the case. We now know that the roots <!--***-->communicate through <!--***-->mycelium
    <br>
    <br>
     They are able to warn other plants of disease and selectively grow their roots or not to allow better chance or not for other plants to take hold. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Roots send signals to microbes and through a complicated chain of interactions involving <!--***-->Humic and Fulvic acids, nutrints and water are express delivered through root membranes and into the plant. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Microbes breakdown dirt transforming unusable nutrients and minerals into everything a plant needs to defend it self, feed it self, and keep itself healthy. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Living soil is by far the most benifical. Although the magic truly happens when a person combines all these techniques together.
     <br>
     <br>
     Removing long distance shipping costs as much as possible is important in reducing food prices and reducing resource damands enough to matter. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Groceries account for more of our monthly purchase budget than almost any other item we buy in stores combined. It cost a ton to feed a family for the year. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Being able to grow plants with no worries for super cheap is critical for our futures... unless you want to <!--***-->eat bugs. I know I don't.
     <br>
     <br>
     Eggs, Chicken and milk are major sales items in grocery stores. Providing these closer helps saves money and resources also. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Creating farms that aren't in debt when a farmer starts production will greatly reduce food prices for lack of major overhead right from the start. A farm that starts out of debt and prices their food accordingly prices their food for way less because they won't have to reduce prices once the mortgage is paid off.
     <br>
     <br>
     Food systems that compliment each other are able to provide more cost savings on top of not needing external feed sources because these are purchases and that is money out thus cost added to food sale price.
     <br>
     <br>
     Closed-Loop production close to the mouths that eat is clear in in its advantages.
     <br>
     <br>
     We also can go verticle in southern windows of highrises. Knock out sections of floor near the widows and build the systems between a new wall and the glass keeping most of the office space available (able to see the plants through windows if desired). All while utilizing the huge area of south facing highrise windows and the sun they get. This even helps reduce summer cooling costs.
     <br>
     <br>
     I cant give any more details away without hindering my own business abilities.
     <br>
     <br>
     The rest of this site is an in depth look at all that I have said. I have more information as well as resources galore to help in many topics. Mostly food production and energy, also other things like website building, water pumping for free, electrical learing, free education resources, cources from major universities and colleges, addiction stuff, community stuff, and more.
