  <h3>
    Introduction:
  </h3>

    This is a wake up call to all of us! Food maters greatly and too many people are going around hungry in life. 
    <br>
    <br>
    We may have made mistakes in the past with how things were grown. We certainly keep hearing more and more about that today then ever before. 
    <br>
    <br>
    All their words are always scary. 
    <br>
    The truth is that it doesn't have to be.
    <br>
    <br>
    This site provides <u>real</u> solutions to <u>real</u> problems in the food industry. I also suggest other ways of sustainability to compliment food production and life.
    
  <ul>  
    <li>Truth maters no matter the cost.</li> 
    <li>Experience is where I come from.</li> 
    <li>My heart is what leads me.</li> 
    <li>Our children are our future.</li>
    <li>Earth is our home.</li> 
    <li>Honor. Loyalty. Care. are equal to all the above.</li>
    <br>
    These ARE the foundations to life and are what matters in the end.
  </ul>

  <h3>
    Hunger:
  </h3>
  
  They say that something like a billion people on Earth are hungry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Does that sound insane to you?
  <br>
  <br>
  I think it is!
  
  <p>
    No person should ever be hungry, not ever! 
       <br>
  Especially when food can be grown for free.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Extra costs on our food:
  </h3>
  
    <ul>
      <li>labour at warehouses outside of local region and shipyards (x2)</li>
      <li>transportation outside of local region</li>
      <li>all that cold storage costs outside regional</li> 
      <br>
      and
      <li>the fuel amd resources associated with all of that</li>
    </ul>
  <p> 
    <b>For most greenhouses add these costs and remove the the above costs:</b>
  </p>
      <ul>
        <li>power</li>
        <li>gas (or electric for heat also)</li>
        <li>yearly shutdown and startup = many unproductive months</li>
        <li>cooling</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>fertilizer or renewing soil</li>
        <li>pesticides when needed are usually needed for the whole place = $$$</li>
      </ul>
      
  <p>
    Fortunately almost all of these costs can be eliminated with a Strategic Greenhouse Systems design.

  <h3>
    Worldwide motivating factors:
  </h3>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Floods do not affect a greenhouse like they do open field crops.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Children and people are starving. To help, food needs to be able to make it through extremes of weather and to grow for more months a year.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Insurance costs go up with catastrophic damage which further creates more costs for our foood.</li>
      <li>Food waste average in Canada is huge. Most of this waste (about 80%) happens before the grocery store shelves - which means between farm and local. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In other words, long distance is the leading cause of food waste by a huge margin. 
      <br>
      <br>
      If true then changing to regional production, or even mostly in country production would reduce food waste by over 90%.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Costs of energy keep going up. We intend to mitigate that with on site energy production fueled by the wastes we create.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Temperature fluxuations and unpredictable weather are decimating food randomly. Some years are bad, others not so much. We need a way around this.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>In holland they have huge areas that are greenhoused. Some areas it goes on for many square kilometers so it not insane to think we can bring home almost year round growth and make a diffeence.
      <br>
      <br>
      The cost to maintain insurance and endure random crop losses is mitigated by indoor growth.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Plant health is better becasue of UV light. UV light is mostly blocked by typical greenhouse glazings. EFTE does not block it, is self cleaning, super light and never fades according to Japanese gardeners who have had it for 30 + years now with no fade or deterioration at all.</li>
      <li>A man in Nebraska grows oranges year round for 50 cents a day and that is it. He keeps the ambient temperature well over 20C year round and does so by blowing air into tubes that go out into his yard and collect ground temp and bring it back in (on cold days). On hot days he collects the hot air and blows it through the same tubes which is now cooler and that cools the greenhouse while capturing that extra heat into the ground for later use.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      
    </ul>
  That was a quick overview of everything, my intentions, the why and some of the how.
