  <h1>
    WELCOME:
  </h1>

    This is a wake up call to all of us! Food maters greatly yet many people are hungry. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In the past we may have made mistakes growning things. We certainly hear about it today more then ever before.
    <br>
    <br>
    Their words are scary. 
    <br>
    The truth is, it's not all that bad... Really :)
    <br>
    <br>
    This site provides <i>useful</i> solutions to <i>real</i> problems facing food production. Our deepest hope is that no one ever gets hungry.
    <br>
    <br>
    We really can feed everyone for so much less money.
    
<hr>
    
  <h3>
    Values and Culture:
  </h3>
    
  <ul>  
    <li>Truth maters - no matter the cost.</li> 
    <li>My heart is what leads me.</li> 
    <li>Our children are our future.</li>
    <li>Earth is our home, we must care for her.</li> 
    <li>Honor - Loyalty - Care.  equals to all the above combined.</li>
    <br>
    <br>
    These ARE the foundations of life. They make what matters in the end matter.
  </ul>
  
<hr>
  
  <h3>
    Hunger:
  </h3>
  
  They say that something like a billion people on Earth are hungry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Does that sound insane to you?
  <br>
  <br>
  It sure does to me!
  
  <p>
    No person should ever be hungry, not ever! 
       <br>
  Especially when food can be grown for free.
  </p>
  
<hr>
  
  <h3>
    Extra costs that local mitigates:
  </h3>
  
    <ul>
     <b> Most produce costs:</b>
      <li>labour at warehouses outside of local region and at shipyards (x2)</li>
      <li>transportation outside of (coming to) the local region</li>
      <li>all that cold storage costs are extra outside local area</li> 
      <br>
      and
      <li>the fuel to drive all forklifts, trucks and ships as well as the resources associated to build all of it</li>
    </ul>
  <p> 
    <b>For most greenhouses add the following costs and remove the above costs:</b>
  </p>
      <ul>
        <li>power</li>
        <li>gas (or electric heat)</li>
        <li>yearly shutdown and startup = many unproductive months</li>
        <li>daytime cooling</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>fertilizer or renewing soil</li>
        <li>pesticides when needed are usually needed for the whole place = $$$</li>
        <li>others</li>
      </ul>
      
  <p>
    Fortunately almost all of these costs can be eliminated with a Strategic Greenhouse Systems design.
      
<hr>
    
  <h3>
    Worldwide motivating factors:
  </h3>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Floods do not affect a greenhouse like they do open field crops.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Children and people are starving. To help, food needs to be able to make it through extremes of weather and to grow for more months a year.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Insurance costs go up with catastrophic damage which further creates more costs for our food.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Food waste average in Canada is huge - over 60% farm to fork. Most of this waste, 90%, happens before the grocery store shelves - which means between farm and outside local is where most waste happens. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In other words, long distance transportation is the leading cause of wasted food. 
      <br>
      <br>
      If true then changing to regional production, or even in country production would reduce food waste by as much as 90%.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Don't forget the costs of energy keeps going up. We intend to mitigate that problem completely with on site energy production fueled by the wastes we create.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Temperature fluxuations and unpredictable weather are decimating food randomly. Some years are bad, others not so much. We need a way around this.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>In holland they have huge areas that are greenhouses. Some areas it goes on for many square kilometers. So it not insane to think we can bring home close to year round growth and make a diffeence.
      <br>
      <br>
      The cost to maintain insurance and endure random crop losses is mitigated by indoor growth.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Plant health is better becasue of UV light. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304423818300967" target="blank"> UV light </a>is mostly blocked by typical greenhouse glazings.*** EFTE does not block it, ETFE is self cleaning, super light, and never fades. This is according to Japanese gardeners who have had ETFE on their greenhouses for over 30 + years now, with no fade or deterioration at all.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>A man in Nebraska grows oranges year round for 50 cents a day and that is it. He keeps the ambient temperature well over 20C year round and does so by blowing air into tubes that go out into his yard and collect ground temp and bring it back in (on cold days). On hot days he collects the hot air and blows it through the same tubes which is now cooler and that cools the greenhouse while capturing that extra heat into the ground for later use.</li>
 
      
    </ul>
  That was just a quick overview of everything, my intentions, some of the why and how.

  <h3>
    Deeper dive into the projects:
  </h3>
  
  
  <h4>Project 1</h4> 
  This greenhouse will prove soil science plus that the chosen glazing is adequate and does as expected. That the automations are efficent and accurate as well. Design is for producing food in diverse applications and can be built almost any where there is southerly sun exposure and any type of water supply. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Even though many good examples of growing similar plants locally exists, we are further showing the power of combining thermal batteries, glazing, living soil, automation, and building design, this will allow delicious food plants to thrive this far north for close to a whole year every year. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Teaching resourcs for soil revitalization as well as what that soil life looks like under the microscope so others can know what they are looking for. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Studying the long term effects of soil life on food growth and posting our results online. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Hourly temperatures records database for records will be kept if possible as well to trend yearly temperatures as residual ground heat increases. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Design, test and implement a farm to fork drone delivery system within 5 years. 
  <br>
  
<hr>

  <h4>Project 2</h4>
  Creates an ok important feed stream for the Chilopoda Farms production facility (project 3). 
  <br>
  <br>
  This step complements the greenhouse in order to make Chilopoda Farms very viable and sustainable. 
  <br>
  <br>
  This Project, #2 is called C&C Farms. It is a turn-key type operation design that uses automated milking and automated egg collection systems as well as automated storage, automated logistics dispatching and automated animal rotation in the paddocks to produce eggs and milk sustainably. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Everything is run for afew years to workthe kinks out and ballance heard and flock size to the food growth capacity of the land depending on number of acres. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Doing this research phase will allow us to pay off the equipment and farm and hopefully also pay for two more farms. This phases of R & D will give adequate time to fine tune packaging and pasturization chain to be balanced with retail sales demands.
  <br>
  <br>
  This gives our customers a well oiled, already funtioning and established business so that they can become farmer with minimal training in a turn key sort of set up. This gives comfort to clients who want to invest in farming but aren't sure because ________. Now they know they will have a future at sign over this way.
  <br>
  <br>.  
  Then we spread them all around a city to produce eggs and milk regionally. Collect it from outlying farms, pasteurize it and package it the city once collected, ship to local retailer. Produce most milk locally at mini farms spread around 100-200 km from city (depending on city population). Mitigate major long distance trucking costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the farm design is ballanced, input costs are significantly less on feed and clean up thanks to the chickens. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Water is from any or all of; well , river, land and roof collected, pumped, or city water. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Heat is and electricity is same supply as greenhouse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chicken feed comes from next project.
  <br>
  <br>
  As mentioned, we intend to pay for the first farm and the next two farms with the first one. When that is done we give away the first one like habitat for humanity does. The next two are now paid for so we run those two until they pay for four more (two more each). 
  <br>
  <br>
  We give #2 and #3 away keeping 4,5,6 and 7. They pay for two more each making 8 so we give the 4 away, make the 8 pay for 16 and give the 8 away. The 16 pays for 32 we give 16 away. 32 pays for 64 we give away 32... and so on and so forth until there are hundreds in a few more moves then we go to new cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  This way we never lose money because once its paid for its ours, we give 70% away splitting profits appropriatly and we will be able to invest in more food designs for research. Plus we promote farming in a new way. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Jersey cow produces about 30 liters a day max. This means that 50 cows produce about 1500 liters a day max. That is about 547,000 liters a year = 273,750 2L containers of milk or 136,875 @ 4 liters each. Even woth loses or shortages we stand to sell 350,000 liters or more yearly.
  <br>
  <br>
  R and D is required to make the milk and egg collection buildings modular for easy drop. If things don't work out in a particular area we simply remove the buildings and truck them to a new location.
  
<hr>
  
  <h4>Project 3</h4> 
  Chilopoda Farms food facility. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Major R and D project to iron out bugs that are expected when combining several processes together. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We are designing this for franchise type implementation and employer share giving.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conspets confirmed by projects #1 and #2. This project specifically works with C&C Farms to supply resources and get reaources. Once fine tuned we can be fit these into old warehouses, malls, store fronts or high-rises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Food sources closer to the mouths they feed are cheaper due to less shipping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deliverable prodcts planned are boiler chickens and laying hens, 2 species fish, various produce, various composts, animal feeds, AND its own energy from ***bio digesting (german garbage trucks) all created waste in bio digesters to produce methane or ethane gas that is then used to fuel a ***cogeneration plant.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <a href="./Cogeneration.html">Cogeneration</a> will be used to provide heating and cooling for food storage. CO2 is directed to the garden to ***boost plant growth. The energy harvested with the electricity produced is 90+% efficient thanks to ***Cummins Cogeneration powerplant.
  <br>
  <br>
    Any extra energy will be given to the grid for free or minimal cost.
    
  <p>
    Closed-loop system to produce food means that nothing will be coming into the building at all. 
    <br>
    <br>
    My research is based upon various literature that show stages of this design seperatly in shorter processes.
    </p>
    
    I have taken several already used and accepted practices and combined them. If the literature is accurate then we should be able to produce food, electricity and its own feed stock from a very simple source. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Wastes are mitigated by creating composts and fuel fo power genration. 
    <br>
   
<hr>
    
    <h4>Project 4</h4> 
    Create all needed energy on site. 
    <br>
    <br>
    We intend to test several designs of energy storage and generation north of Edmonton (for viability). 
    <br>
    <br>
    Solar may make sense in the summer or down south. It certainly doesn't make sense here where the winter there is only 5 to 6 hours of sunlight a day while the rest is night. That is not useful so we are planning to test combinations of energy production with combinations of energy storage to see what works best.
