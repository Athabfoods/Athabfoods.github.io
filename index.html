    Can we produce food sustainably, or is that just a pipedream? I beleive if done right, we CAN actually do so... but it is not easy without resources and a plan.
    <br>
    What follows outlines that and more. 
  </p>
  
  <p>People should never be hungry. Most food grows for free... so why do we have to pay ever increasing amounts of our hard earned money for it? I think we can reduce the majority of our costs easily while upholding to organic standards and reducing environmental impact and demand.

  <h3>
    Earth:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Nature is beautiful, did you know? All her sounds, with birds chirping and skwaking, buzzing in the air and the air making noise as it russles the leaves. It is no wonder they say "Earth is a living planet". 
      <br>
    It literally is. 
      <br>
    Did you know that for as much life as there is above ground, many factors more exist below our feet in the ground? 
      <br>
    Did you know we can sequester oodles of CO2 into the soil by simply growing plants?
      <br>
  </p>
  
      <br>
      
  <h3>
    Living soil:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Did I say living soil? I sure did. In fact the soil is teeming with life. Some say that soil is so diverse in microbes that for every tablespoon there is billions of individual living somethings. 
      <br>
    And all those somethings must do something right?
      <br>
    The amswer is... to be honest, were still working on it. But early indicators we can say with certainty that soil life can greatly impact plant life positively as much as not having soil life can be not so good for plants.
      <br>
    How not good? Well that is complicated. You see I have been discovering that it is not entirely the soil life that impacts how, and what, plants contribute to their environment. 
      <br>
    Again, with certainty I can say that no soil life means a plant is more or less defenseless. However, what I do not understand is why adding certain amendments do the things they do, both to the plant and to root zone.
      <br>
    We will go deeper into this later. For now just know that all evidence thus far suggests that we can prevent plant issues such as pests, fungus and the likes, as well as root issues and more with just myco inoculations. There are billions of little guys in there and hundreds if not thousands upon thousands of types too, each with a special thing they digest, communicate or return answers back to the plant.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Plants:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Yes! you read that right. There are communications happening from the plants through the roots and to the microbes and back. The plants send ***exudates and can signal anything from I am sick and need such and such, to I am deficient in this nutrient, to I have a pest infection send ______ to help me flush it out. Some plants even know when their own seed is there and kill their roots in that area in order to ***allow its own seed to grow while it does not do that for other trees even of the same species.
      <br>
    Plants ***have memory and can react (like ***venus fly trap)
      to events in their environment.
  </p>
      
  <h3>
    Microbes:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Microbes... as I said, these are complicated. Will go much deeper into this later.
      <br>
    As I mentioned, intresting things happen to soil amd plants with certain amendments. Some seem to make it so the roots of more plants can ***fix nitrogen.
    Plants become super cold resilient. 
      <br>
    They are able to take on more water than normal without rood damage or stunted growth. They handle droughts just as well. 
      <br>
    They can somehow pick themselves up off the ground somehow. In other words, plants that once lay on dirt, that you normally have to watch food for rot becasue they do, no longer stay on the ground and literally grow upright firmly and are also quite wind resistant. As in, we had a week of super winds, well over 100km/hr (our weather station only registers that high), and yet our garden was fine for the most part. However other plants, outside the garden, were not so fair off, Trees had many down leaves and branches worse in some cases. Granted, the garden is low lying plants, but even our tomatoes and peas (the ones that climb) were fine.
    <br>
  What ever comes to life in soil that helps plants, it does wonders that I am sure we are only on the edge to figuring out, since it is a new science and all...
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    The garden system:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    This is where it gets fun. So we figure that we can grow many foods up north in some places just as easy as we can down south outside. Sure it is inside, but here has to be a point where logistics and reducing climate impact matters more than how it is done.
      <br>
    When one considers the impact soil science has on the outcome of plants. What I mean is that once you realize how many parts of a growing plant benefit from soil life being there, you start to push the plants to points of extreme that just don't seem possible. And then they not only survive, but thrive... it goes against all that I have seen while growing up.
      <br>
    I thought... wow... we can really do somthing good for people with this. Like really! And thats when I cooked up some of my newer ideas on how to handle business growth.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    The concepts:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    So. First project is a simple greenhouse atfirst look. But it is not simple at all.
      <br>
    It will capture all daytime heat and store it underground in the floor of the greenhouse for redistribution when it is winter and especially those nights.
      <br>
    This greenhouse will test soil science thoroughly north of Edmonton, not only for viability, but also for possibility of extreme north aplications.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Energy. To grid or not to grid:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    We will have multiple sources of renewable energy production on site. 
      <br>
    Thermo-photo voltaic cells need sun and the sun isn't always shining so we decided on a combo with mini wind as well as a potential to utilize hydrogen fuel cells. 
      <br>
    With energy storage. Perhaps the power wall or redox-flow batteries. Or a combination of both. For those particularly long winter nights up here.
      <br>
    Energy has to be made on site to prevent impacting food costs any further. 
      <br>
    Especially as energy always goes up, not down. If current long term trends hold true then it would not be good to neglect energy consumption mitigation. 
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Glazing and structure:
  <h3>
  
  <p>
    To further benifit from natural ground warmth, the green house will be in the ground on the north side.
      <br>
    Because the glazing target is for EFTE to replace what is typically lexan or glass, there will be significantly less weight to hold up with the structure. This will benifit us nicely as we can now create verticall systems off of these roof supports along the column isles. This will greatly increase our food output.
      <br>
    Since this is an inground greenhouse, when going from south to north inside will be uphill in teirs. This is to allow sun penetration through the rows of trees to clear the leaves so as to create equal lighting throughout while maximizing food production space. Tomatoes in the ground and above rows upon rows of strawberries in auto rotation planters.
      <br>
    To further create more layers of food production the rows of trees will all have rows of dwarf mangos and other dwarf varieties, as well as smaller plants to be plated in between trees for the rows running east west.
      <br>
    Water will be collected on the land and stored in outdoor dugouts on property. Rolling hills. Run off can easily be colllected in a water supply system, outlined later on.

  The next page is the index (Home) page.
  <br>
  From there the site opens up to provide you with resources and to support my ramblings above. 
      <br>
  The index (Home) page contains a brief description of the website as well as a contents section to describe each page and its contents.
      <br>
  Links are to subsequent pages.
  <br>
  Projects further describes my Greenhouse and other food systems are planned.
      <br>
  A page is dedicated to why it will work which shows relevant info as suggestions that I am not fully insane wanting to grow Citrus this far north.
      <br>
  As well as pages on soil and plant life (in depth), the company vision and goals, an area dedicated to learning in general, video documentaries section, and more.
  <br>
  Each major section has a contents part near the top, this breifly describes the contents of those links.
