  <h3>
    Introduction:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Can we produce food sustainably? Or is that just a pipedream? 
    <br>
    I beleive if done right, we CAN actually do s in a profound way.
    <br>
    What follows throughout outlines that... and much more. 
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Hunger:
  </h3>
  
  Did you know that they say that something like a billion people are hungry on Earth.
  <br>
  Isn't that insane sounding to you? I think it is!
  
  <p>No person should ever be hungry, not ever. Especially when food grows for free.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Extra costs on food:
  </h3>
  
    <ul>
      <li>labour</li>
      <li>transportation</li>
      <li>storage</li> 
      <li>and</li> 
      <li>retailing</li>
    </ul>
    
  <h3>
    Winter and food growth:
  </h3>
  
  Food can not grow when frozen, that is a fact. This is probably the biggest contributor to food costs, hands down. 
  <p>
  Greenhouse growing is even more expensive the further north you go. This is due to cold winters and heating costs, the longer and more bitter the winter, ie: the further north you go and the more hours of night you see increases which meams you will have to spend more to heat a greenhouse. This makes producing food year round a southern thing, that, or a very expensive thing if choosing to do so and that is because of greenhouse design. They are designed to grow many square feet of food under glass as possble and so their design is often huge rectangles, great for summer sollar gain, equally as awesome at losing heat in the night / winter. Not so good at keeping food costs down. Since the costs of energy keep on the rise, then what we have is a recipe for food poverty and there is not much government can do about that.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    You did say we could do something about it though, right?
  </h3>
  
  I sure did. As I was daying... it is about design as much as it is about technology and those two equal the importance of understanding soil science and more specifically living soils and substrates. Combined, I feel that they have a potential to offer us a financially sound way of long term food production in countless regions.
  <h3>
    How many ways can food be grown sustainably?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    The crazy part is that I think that we can not only grow food sustainably, we can produce food in a closed loop facility that does not require inputs nor does it require power or heat from the grid at all. In fact, it produces energy it self, along side 
    <ul>
      <li>chickens-boilers and hens</li>
      <li>2 fish species, possibly more</li>
      <li>plants of various types</li>
      <li>and a few other things as well</li>
    </ul>
    
  <p>
    Again, that is closed-loop with nothing comimg into the building at all (based on various literature resources that show specific stages of this design seperated. Whereas I have combined several together to create a chain that, if the literature is accurate, then food production can not only produce food, but electricity also.
  </p>
  
  This requires the first two projects to work out so that the variables are controlled to make sure feasibility is real.
  
  <h3>
    Breif overview of projects:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
  Project 1, the greenhouse proves soil science plus that the glazing is adequate and does as expected, amd that the automations are efficent and accurate as well. This is for placing in tight situations and producing food woth diverse applications any where needed.
  <br>
  Project 2, creates an inportant feed stream for closed-loop production to make it 98% viable. Project 2 is a turn-key operation that irons out all the kinks before the customers take over and when they do it is in a way that they walk into a well oiled, already funtioning, integrated businss with retail established so that they can become farmer, or expand their operations in a sustainable way to produce eggs and milk. For rural and close to cities (within 100-200km).
  <br>
  Project 3 is the closed-loop facility design for cookie cutter implementation. This is the Urban counterpart and can be fitter to old warehouses, etc for a diverse food production facility closer to the mouths.
  <br>
    Project 4 is energy use mitigation, we intend to test several designs of energy storage north of Edmonton (for viability) as wel as test various production methods. Being ee are so far north, using solar may make sense in the summer but it certainly doesn't make semse in the winter when there is only 5-7 hours of sunlight daily, the rest is night. Ideas include hydrogen genration unit, fuel cells, other combinations of technology like heat engines, gravity fed turbines fed for free from ram pump,and a few more.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Where to find out more?
  </h3>
  
  Everything I have talkd about and will mention om this page is verifiable <a href="./Home.html">here</a>. 
  <p>
    However, please keep reading to get an overview of everything, this will help when searching through my site.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    I'm confused, do you mean to say that we can eat food for free?
  </h3>
    
  
  <p>
  <i>That</i>, my good friend, is an excellent question.
  </p>

  <p>
    Will food ever cost less?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Maybe...
    <br>
    I mean, hopefully, if I have anything to do about it then yes. 
    <br>
    Truthfully, I don't know honestly and I am worried that this reality will be quited just like it has been for so many others. 
  </p>
  
    Here's what I do know. What I know is that we our selves are all we can trust for bringing change to our own lives. We have waited on the government for too long to do something good for us.
    <br>
    Clearly they have their hands full trying to do other things. Which is fine. 
    <br>
  <p>
      What is not fine though is that people are hungry and food is free.
  </p>
    
  <h3> 
    City streets and hunger:
  </h3>
    
    <br>
    Think about this. If cities planted food in their boulevards, like berry and fruit bushes, and they did that for one out of every 10 trees that they planted back when they built their strees... then today there would be hundreds of thousands, probably millions of food producing trees and shrubs spread accross countless streets in various towns, villages, cities, and urban areas... what then? Don't you think that some, if not many of the millions of hungry people could be fed?
    <br>
    <br>
    Money was spent to buy those trees along the streets anyways... so why not spend it on fruit trees that can feed its citizens?!?

  <p>
      Like I was saying, clearly if we are going to get help it ain't coming from them... and no one else is stepping up to feed us as they should.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Expecting our government to help us:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
     Sadly, it us that must take the initiative if we ever hope to see this get better.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    My opinion:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
  I think we can reduce the majority of our costs easily, while upholding to organic standards, ALL WHILE reducing environmental impact and demand significantly.

  Where we live:
</h1>
  
  <h3>
    Earth:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Nature is beautiful, did you know? All her sounds, with birds chirping and skwaking, buzzing in the air and the air making noise as it russles the leaves. It is no wonder they say "Earth is a living planet". 
      <br>
    It literally is. 
      <br>
    Did you know that for as much life as there is above ground, many factors more exist below our feet in the ground? 
      <br>
    Did you know we can sequester oodles of CO2 into the soil by simply growing plants?
      <br>
  </p>
  
      <br>
      
  <h3>
    Living soil:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Did I say living soil? I sure did. In fact the soil is teeming with life. Some say that soil is so diverse in microbes that for every tablespoon there is billions of individual living somethings. 
      <br>
    And all those somethings must do something right?
      <br>
    The amswer is... to be honest, were still working on it. But early indicators we can say with certainty that soil life can greatly impact plant life positively as much as not having soil life can be not so good for plants.
      <br>
    How not good? Well that is complicated. You see I have been discovering that it is not entirely the soil life that impacts how, and what, plants contribute to their environment. 
      <br>
    Again, with certainty I can say that no soil life means a plant is more or less defenseless. However, what I do not understand is why adding certain amendments do the things they do, both to the plant and to root zone.
      <br>
    We will go deeper into this later. For now just know that all evidence thus far suggests that we can prevent plant issues such as pests, fungus and the likes, as well as root issues and more with just myco inoculations. There are billions of little guys in there and hundreds if not thousands upon thousands of types too, each with a special thing they digest, communicate or return answers back to the plant.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Plants:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Yes! you read that right. There are communications happening from the plants through the roots and to the microbes and back. The plants send ***exudates and can signal anything from I am sick and need such and such, to I am deficient in this nutrient, to I have a pest infection send ______ to help me flush it out. Some plants even know when their own seed is there and kill their roots in that area in order to ***allow its own seed to grow while it does not do that for other trees even of the same species.
      <br>
    Plants ***have memory and can react (like ***venus fly trap)
      to events in their environment.
  </p>
      
  <h3>
    Microbes:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Microbes... as I said, these are complicated. Will go much deeper into this later.
      <br>
    As I mentioned, intresting things happen to soil amd plants with certain amendments. Some seem to make it so the roots of more plants can ***fix nitrogen.
    Plants become super cold resilient. 
      <br>
    They are able to take on more water than normal without rood damage or stunted growth. They handle droughts just as well. 
      <br>
    They can somehow pick themselves up off the ground somehow. In other words, plants that once lay on dirt, that you normally have to watch food for rot becasue they do, no longer stay on the ground and literally grow upright firmly and are also quite wind resistant. As in, we had a week of super winds, well over 100km/hr (our weather station only registers that high), and yet our garden was fine for the most part. However other plants, outside the garden, were not so fair off, Trees had many down leaves and branches worse in some cases. Granted, the garden is low lying plants, but even our tomatoes and peas (the ones that climb) were fine.
    <br>
  What ever comes to life in soil that helps plants, it does wonders that I am sure we are only on the edge to figuring out, since it is a new science and all...
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    The garden system:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    This is where it gets fun. So we figure that we can grow many foods up north in some places just as easy as we can down south outside. Sure it is inside, but here has to be a point where logistics and reducing climate impact matters more than how it is done.
      <br>
    When one considers the impact soil science has on the outcome of plants. What I mean is that once you realize how many parts of a growing plant benefit from soil life being there, you start to push the plants to points of extreme that just don't seem possible. And then they not only survive, but thrive... it goes against all that I have seen while growing up.
      <br>
    I thought... wow... we can really do somthing good for people with this. Like really! And thats when I cooked up some of my newer ideas on how to handle business growth.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    The concepts:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    So. First project is a simple greenhouse atfirst look. But it is not simple at all.
      <br>
    It will capture all daytime heat and store it underground in the floor of the greenhouse for redistribution when it is winter and especially those nights.
      <br>
    This greenhouse will test soil science thoroughly north of Edmonton, not only for viability, but also for possibility of extreme north aplications.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Energy. To grid or not to grid:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    We will have multiple sources of renewable energy production on site. 
      <br>
    Thermo-photo voltaic cells need sun and the sun isn't always shining so we decided on a combo with mini wind as well as a potential to utilize hydrogen fuel cells. 
      <br>
    With energy storage. Perhaps the power wall or redox-flow batteries. Or a combination of both. For those particularly long winter nights up here.
      <br>
    Energy has to be made on site to prevent impacting food costs any further. 
      <br>
    Especially as energy always goes up, not down. If current long term trends hold true then it would not be good to neglect energy consumption mitigation. 
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Glazing and structure:
  <h3>
  
  <p>
    To further benifit from natural ground warmth, the green house will be in the ground on the north side.
      <br>
    Because the glazing target is for EFTE to replace what is typically lexan or glass, there will be significantly less weight to hold up with the structure. This will benifit us nicely as we can now create verticall systems off of these roof supports along the column isles. This will greatly increase our food output.
      <br>
    Since this is an inground greenhouse, when going from south to north inside will be uphill in teirs. This is to allow sun penetration through the rows of trees to clear the leaves so as to create equal lighting throughout while maximizing food production space. Tomatoes in the ground and above rows upon rows of strawberries in auto rotation planters.
      <br>
    To further create more layers of food production the rows of trees will all have rows of dwarf mangos and other dwarf varieties, as well as smaller plants to be plated in between trees for the rows running east west.
      <br>
    Water will be collected on the land and stored in outdoor dugouts on property. Rolling hills. Run off can easily be colllected in a water supply system, outlined later on.

  <br>
  Projects further describes my Greenhouse and other food systems are planned.
      <br>
  A page is dedicated to why it will work which shows relevant info as suggestions that I am not fully insane wanting to grow Citrus this far north.
      <br>
  As well as pages on soil and plant life (in depth), the company vision and goals, an area dedicated to learning in general, video documentaries section, and more.
  <br>
  Each major section has a contents part near the top, this breifly describes the contents of those links.
