<h2>
  Hunger and Propaganda:
</h2>

  Food matters greatly yet <!--***-->people frequently are hungry. 
  
<h3>
  In the news:
</h3>

    They claim that we have made mistakes in our fields. We certainly <!--***-->hear about it more today then ever before. But is that true? Are we really at a state of no return in agriculture? Or is that just another reason for them to charge us more $$$?
  <p>
    It is difficult to tell because their words are usually <!--***-->ominous and scarry sounding. Are they really fighting for our best interest? I don't know.
  </p>
    
  <h4>
    The truth is:
  </h4>
  
    It <!--***--> doesn't have to be that bad. Feilds can easily be fixed. Food can be grown sustainably with minimal cost. In most cases we can grow food better without chemicals than we can with. We can produce food without waste accumulation. Also, energy can be generated in other ways. Best part is, it does not take all that they claim to preserve the environment. 
    <br>
    <br>
    It takes designs considerations combined with other technologies, sciences and techniques. The more that is considered, the better the outcome righ up to allowing us to provide food systems that grow almost year round even in the winter and snowy regions.
    <p>
    Here at Strategic Food Systems we make everything good possible.. :)

  <h2>
    My Journey:
  </h2>

  <h3>
    What is Organic?:
  </h3>

    On my journey learning about food I discovered that organic food wasn't as it seemed. Organics, such as hydroponics, are supposed to be 'naturally grown foods'.
  <br>
  <br>
    As it turns out, organic plant food is often chemicals purified from natural materials. In other words, we take natural minerals and nutrients and then chemically extract a specific element we need, like Nitrogen, Potassium and Phosphorus.
  <br>
  <br>
  Technically this means that organic fertilizer is actually not organic at all. Rather, organics are chemicals synthesized from organic sources.
   
  <h3>
    Enter Veganics:
  </h3>
  
    What are veganics? Veganics is the term used to describe vegan organic plant growth. Taking non animal sourced materials and growing plants in that.
    <br>
    <br>
    Another way to describe this is substrate, super soil or living soil, the last two being even more beneficial for robust plant growth and resilience.
    <br>
    <br>
    However the knowledge required to grow food 100% naturally has been marred with contradictions, claims of being unrealistic or impossible, claims of it being sudo science, and vested intrests willing to preserve their investments.

  <h3>
    Why is this important?
  </h3>
  As mentioned, organic fertilizers are derived from natural resources. Many of the same natural resources that are used to promote living soil. Living soil takes a wide range of components to accomlish well. Synthesising a resource means taking a product with a diverse mineral and nutrient profile and extracting just one, two or a few specific molocules or elements. This process rejects many other useful items that living soil needs to produce one of the three above mentioned NPK chemicals.
  
  <h3>
    Nutrients:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
  Other than NPK (Nitrogen, Potassium and Phosphorus) here is a list of nutrients that soil bound plants need to not just live, but thrive:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Calcium</li>
    <li>Magnesium</li>
    <li>Iron</li>
    <li>Sulphur</li>
    <li>Manganese</li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Thats not all either. Plants actually require other things as well.
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Silica is needed to keep plants stong. We almost never supply silica to our plants through the soil. Greensand<!-- and d Earth -->are excellent sources of silica.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Minerals. Just like we need electrolytes to function, plants need Minerals too. Minerals are found in soil thanks to glaciation depositing fine ground rock dust to our soils. Sources of this are; (Glacial) Rock Dust, Greensand and AZOMITE (acronym meaning A to Z Of Minerals In The Earth). These provide many things, mostly for the soil microbes, but also for some plant requirements too.</li>
      <br>
      <li>BioChar, a fancy name for charcoal. Not quite the same as charcoal because it is burnt in an oxygen depleted environment in order to prevent ashes from being the main result. 
      <br>
      <br>
      What this creates are charcoal chunks that are complex structures provideimg homes for microbes as well as pockets for oxygen and water. 
      <br>
      <br>
      You ever notice how after a forest fire blackening everything the following growth is super green and seems to grow faster? This is why.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Humic and Fulvic acids. What are these? They are similar to charcoal except instead of burning wood to produce the product, nature uses slow decomposition. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Humic acid blend is a complex product from peat bogs. It is said to take countless centries to generate. Thankfully once they are in the soil, they stay. 
      <br>
      <br>
      What Humic and Fulvic acids do is complex, generally they become an express route for water and nutrients to enter the roots membranes without resistance. This is accomplished by penetrating the root membrane while hooking up to the production end of microbes in order to <!--***-->scelate food to the plant by createing an efficent pathway from source. 
      <p>
      Notice how they also hook up with microbes? They are part and parcel to the root zone system just as the home for the microbes are. Liquid Karma is great and powdered products are lifetime lasting.
      </li></p>
    </ul>
  These are super important to super soil success.
  
  <h3>
    Other product benifits:
  </h3>
    The following products provide characteristics that are useful.
    <ul>
      <li>Kelp, for good for soil life. Kelp is diverse in elements and mineral ad well as having a diversity of micro life.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Alfalfa meal. As well as being a great amendment this product helps accelerate plant growth naturaly.</li>
      <li>Neem oil and Neem cake meal. Neem is from a tree in the East calld the tree if life Banned recentl in Canada, it is a natural product that can be sprayed on a plant to deter pests and moulds.It is harmless to bees and non invasive creatures. It is a plant product that works very well in these ways. I have used it plenty with surprisingly effective results.</li>
    </ul>
    These are just an example of how natural products help plant health, life and production.


  <h3>
    Is it worth creating living soil ?:
  </h3>

  Short answer, YES, unequivocally. Growing your own food is not only thrilling, it's rewarding on so many levels.
  
  Imagine feating frost and not losing crops because of it? 
  <p>
  I have ended up with edible food after a few frosts becasue of this style of gardening. 
  </p>
  
Not just one frost on one plant, at least 3 frosts in a row (I was away from the farm) hit y gardens and we still having had edible peppers and tomatoes. Not just a few survived, the other way around. Only a few had to be thrown out.
  <p>
    I am also xerain of this because the other plants were wilted, dark colored and looking dead throughout the yeard. That was year one.
    <p>
      Last year (summer 2022) I potter peppers outside on purpose. When I seem frost I went outside to see for myself. What I was found still leaves me feeling ways that I don't know how to express.
      </p>
      The peppers (in pots sitting on the ground, not in it) were beyond what I expected. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Crisp and crunchy still, edible, hot and tasty still. Hanging off a branch... not sagging. Leaves and stems still moveable and flexible as if not frozen. 
      <br>
      <br>While the rest of the gardens plants were frozen stiff. I touch the peas beside me and crunch... IT IS frozen! Weird I think, so I bend a leaf and SNAP! it's definitely frozen. (I think it was) Tomatoes next, regardless, same thing, frozen as well and one other plant... 
      <br>I was pretty excited at that point so specifics are evading my memory.
  <p>
    Nonetheless, two years in a row, same experience. Once on purpose. I was speachless and still have trouble expressing myself on this topic.
  </p>

<h3>
  But it Does Not End There:
</h3>

<h4>
  To much rain. No problem!:
</h4>

  Although I can't say for certain if this was because I use fabric pots I make myself with a low flame and landscaping cloth, or from the supersoil it self, it was likely a combination. We had a month two years ago that we saw almost 400mm of rain in. For us that's about a seasons worth. 
  <br>
  <br>
  While ny garden plants showed signs of over watering (looks like the leaves are soggy limp and the plant sort of droops sort of even bend in the middles section of the leaf (no color changes or spots or anything). This is opposed to the leaves bending in the middle limp like, which signifies under watering and looks more like a sharp bend right in the middle of the leaf) my potted plants were still perky and bot seeming bothered by the water. 
  <br>
  <br>Again, these are hot peppers and tomatoes. I use them as my test victims in my soil experiments.Peppers because they don't grow well in Alberta and are dry plabts. Tomatoes becase they are wet plants. They both provide hanging fruit giving a sort of similar representation of plants and their requirements at both ends of the spectrum.
  <br>
  The tomatoes are in ground and I have control plots as well. The tomatoes that are amended exibit the same characteristics as all of the potted peppers do. The tomatoes that have no amendments are like the rest of the garden. There are no controls with my pepper plants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exact same area is used for exerimenting with super soil with an exclusion zone around that are not examined when I do take notes. This is so I don't spoil th results (as best as possible with minimal funds).
  <br>
  <br>
  But that's not all. super soil plants grow faster and stronger. They resist winds and drought, their foods taste WAAAY better than at the store and are tastier and juicier than gardened food as well. 
  <p>
    Furthermore, plants like strawberries and rhubarb, which are saggy shrubby types. When sprayed with soil life inoculant, start to pick themselves up off the ground and after a few weeks are no longer on the ground.The leaves perk up and cup upwards to collect water and funnel it down the stem right at the roots. The best part is that I no longer have to throw away rotting products that are on the ground that get damp from morning dew and rain. The strawberries are firm and hanging as well as every stem of rhubarb pointing at the sky. This is when I discovered that it may not all be from the amendments at all. More testing requied.

<h3>
  My Plan
</3>
What if we take the above and then do the following? We utilize:
  <ul>
    <li>Building design enhancments - to extend growing season and remove heating and cooling requirements.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Special greenhouse technologies - to further assist in promoting the perfect environment for plants in a greehouse.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Automation - to reduce costs for labour and resources.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Companion planting - helps plants in various ways. Repels pests for other plabts that attract them, promotes growth and flavor, attracts polinators or protectors, deters annoying plants, etc.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Symbiotic planing - creates defence and backup resource supply networks for the root system.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Consideration for what a plant provides to the soil in its life (rotational croping) - this is how to resupply nutrients to the soil and how to fix nitrogen (legumes do this well).</li>
    <br>
    <li>Thermal battery (heat storage) - to save heat in ground for later use at night or in the winter.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Water oxygenation - helps the roots and plant in general by reducing chance of root rot and assising in other plabt functions like processing sugars and starches.</li>
    <br>
    <li>On site energy production and storage - to remove food production from the grid so that energy cost does not increase over time. Higher energy costs mean higher food costs if that food is growb in a facility that needs energy.</li>
  </ul>
  My experience with these is that they all have their own advantages, some I've listed that I have noticed myself.
  
<h3>
  Where do microbes come from?:
</h3>

   <br>
      <li>A person should also monitor the propogation of microbes throughout the soil with a microscope. <!--***-->see microscope section. Coming soon.</li>
    </ul>
  
<h4>
  Plants and Oxygen:
</h4>
  
  <p>  
    Did you know that <!--***-->plants require Oxygen? 
  </p>
  
  They do. Not much, but they do.
  <br>
  <br>
  In nature, it usually happens when rain falls. As raindrops fall they become concentrated with O2 (oxygenated). When a drop hits the ground it takes that trapped oxygen into the ground with it. This oxygenates the roots which helps the roots do their routine more efficiently. This adds other <!--***-->positive effects to the plant as wel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Why? Oxygen promotes the roots to help a plant process starches and sugars more efficiently. We all know how essential sugars are to photosynthesis. Photosynthesis has another waste product besides Oxygen, it's starch. Starch is mostly processed at night making this important because plants slow down at night but have a whole days worth of starch to process for the next day. 

<h4>
  One single plant breath:
</h4>

<p>
  A plant actually breathes once per day. 
</p>
During the day, oxygen is exchanged out the leaves while absorbing carbon dioxide. Starting the breath cycle (inhalation).

At night the roots take in Oxygen and expel CO2. Completing the full breath by exhalation.


<h3>
  Lightning helps too:
</h3>

  Lightning atomizes the air with every strike.
  <br>
  <br>
   There are studies that suggest this helps sterilize water by atomizing the atmosphere around the rain as it falls. 
   <br>
   
   <p>
     That about completes what we can do to promote better growth through the root zone. There are other things we can do but their cost is not worth doing them.
<hr>
<hr>

<h4>
  Specifically, living soil can put the following in the rearview:
</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Fertilizing.</li>
    <li>Occasional pests, moulds, etc.</li>
    <li>Root zone issues with over watering.</li>
    <li>Weather damage- wind, hail etc.</li>
    <li>Heating and cooling costs.</li>
    <li>Short seasons due to cold.</li>
    <li>Even shorter season length in Northern climates due to winter.</li>
    <li>Lost quality because of long distance shippeding.</li>
    <li>Short life of most produce after purchase.</li>
    <li>Major watering costs, in most cases.</li>
    <li>Spring and Fall growth slowdown due to temperature.</li>
    <li>Not avoidable minor costs might include tools, pots, watering equipmemt, sprayers, pruners, etc. These are typically one time purchases only.</li>
  </ul>

<hr>  

<h3>
  Plants grow for free:
</h3>
  
  The actual growing of a plant is done by the soil, the water and the sunlight. We do nothing there. We do have to plant the seeds or seedlings, we have to weed throughout the year and then we harvest. The rest, besides watering, should not cost you or I more atthe store!
  
<hr>


<h3>
  Reducing costs:
</h3>

<h4>
  Weeding:
</h4>

Time weeding is mitogated by top dressing the base of plants or using filter cloth or weed stop. You can also use cardboard to stop weeds. Cardboard eventually becomes part of the soil feeding it slightly. 
  <br>
  <br>
For the plants simply cut holes in the above weed stop materials that are slightly bigger than the trunk or stem will be. This reduces the area needing to be weeded significantly, saving many hours of time in a year. 
<br>
<br>
Another way to slow weeds down is with wood chips, shredded bark, grass clippings, or raked up yard leaves.

<h4>
  Seeding:
</h4>

You can use an <!--***-->auto seeder or a <!--***-->hand held seeder to save time.

<h4>
  Harvesting:
</h4>

<!--***-->Microgreens hand held harvester. Different <!--***Lee valley-->hand held tools. <!--***-->Automated harvesting. <!--***-->Drones.

<h4>
  Watering:
</h4>

Automated <!--***-->watering with in ground sensors and condition monotoring systems. Run an aquarium bubbler in water at all times for O2. Store water in opaque tanks that are in direct sun light for <!--***-->UV steralization.

<h4>
  Water:
</h4>

Collect rain water and snow runoff from buildings. Dehumidify water. Water wells. Land run off diversion and collection then use <!--Rampumps--> rampumps to pump water for free. Solar power and batteries pump backups.

<h4>
  Energy:
</h4>

Produce electricity on site and store it. See <!--***-->energy section for more information on this (under construction).

<h4>
  Artificial lighting for season extension:
</h4>

There is one type of HID lighting, called <!--***-->plasma lights. These beauties are super efficient. They do not have to be close to a plant like other HIDs. They cast enough light through the branches. They can hang on the roof and provide lumens through the entire depth of the branches to the ground with no need for multiple lights side by side saving immensely on power bills. Use energy generation and storage to help with the costs.

<hr>
<hr>

<h3>
  Root rot:
</h3>

<p>
Some plants can not tollerate being wet for extended periods. This is how plants get <!--Rootrot-->root rot easily and must be prevented at all costs. Thankfully living soil is amazing at preventing this except in extreme situations.
</p> 
  
  Be sure to check your plant varieties online or on an <!--extention office-->extention office website to see if your variety has any thing you should know before you plant them.
  
<hr>

<h3>
  Top dressing:
</h3>

  Top dressing helps retain moisture longer, keeps weeds down, prevents bugs, helps fertilize, protects against the hot sun drying the base of your plant out. But top dressing is sketchy at times. Check online to see if you should or should not top dress your roots.

  <p>
  *If you do, DON'T let any top dressing touch the stems of plants or tree trunks. Always keep back 3+ inches and only apply an inch or two thick.
</p>
  
<hr>
<hr>

<h3>
  To summarize thus far:
</h3>

  It turns out that growing a plant simply can end up being more work than planned.

Even though it seems like there are many moving parts in veganics it only sounds that way. Im the end it is more about knowing what to watch out for and reacting ahead of something becoming an issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Setting everyting up is the hardest part aside from learning. Once things get going though, it only becomes easier and more efficient the longer conditions are maintained. 
  <br>
  <br>This is why I mentioned microscope skills... they are required for knowing what you do or do not have in your soils and composts. 
  <br>
  <br>Thankfully those skills can <!--***-->easily be learnt online.

<h3>
  Light matters to plants:
</h3>

    Last and almsot the most important fact is the type of light a plant gets. Plants grow best in the sun, plain and simple. Indoors or outdoors, it doesn't matter. The best growth rates come from the sun, period! 

<h4>
  Artificial lights:
</h4>

    Because HID lights get way to hot indoors providing less <!--***-->lumens then the sun can naturaly. It makes sense not to use them.
    <p>
      Note: Lumens are the amount of light energy (photons) per square foot that hits a surface. More lumens equals faster and more robust growth. 
    </p>

    Lights are crazy expensive for both for the low powered option *<!--***-->LEDs (equipment and set up costs). The cheap set up version HIDs use huge amounts of <!--***-->energy (1000kwh per bulb). 
    
  <!--Show costs for lights below-->  
    <p>
    Furthermore, the bulbs only last so long and must be replaced eventually. Even for LEDs. Although LEDs are significantly longer life they still do have a maximum service time but they are many fold more expensive to replace then high pressure sodium or metal halide bulbs because you have replace more than just a bulb.

  <h3>
    Initial set up:
  </h3>
    Like with anything, you have to purchase items to start out. Things like soil, pots, watering systems, ventilation, greenhouse structure, etc., all need purchasing anyways. Simply substitute some of the initial items for certain other ones instead and in the long run less is spent.
    <br>
    <br>
    Instead of soil buy <!--***-->pre amended <!--***-->starter soils.

  <h3>
    Breif Recap:
  </h3>
  
    With these examples of what can be accomplished we get closer to year round food growth, locally, without numerous added costs, while implementing many cost reduction strategies, with nearly zero pest issues, no need for fertilizers, to create the ability to grow most of what we desire locally closer to the mouths that eat it.
    <br>
    <br>
    Finally, we infuse renewable energy sources alongside energy storage systems to mitigate all unnecessary costs that utilities can create.
    <br>
    <br>
    We create thermal storage in the ground under the greenhouse floor to 'store' extra greenhouse heat in the dirt for use later on when it is cold.
    <br>
    <br>
    We burry half the greenhouse in the summer to trap more heat in the dirt of the north wall and to be in the ground as an extra layer of protection from the cold.
    <br>
    <br>
    We align the south windows to the winter suns highest solar angle so winter heating is maximized on the shortest days of the year.
    <br>
    <br>
    Then we use soil science (living soil) as well as various planting techniques and add them to other techniques that others have used. More on that later.

  <h3>
    Expected outcome:
  </h3>

    The creation of resilient food production systems.
    <br>
    <br>
    Together these can have an important role in our future and for our collective food freedom. 

<hr>

  <h3>
    Summarizing:
  </h3>
  
    We all need plant foods for healthy long lives. Thankfully this can easily be accomplished through the abilities of nature alone. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This all started from observing a forest compared to a field. If you were to do so for long enough you begin to notice that a forest can cycle through layers of dead fall every year with incredible ease, while a field does not do so well in comparison.
    <br>
    <br>
    This happens because of living soil. Which actually happens becase of decomposition of previous plant materials combined with animal wastes, carcasses and more. Together they create an environment that allows a plant to be able to diversely fend (and defend) for itself effectively and successfully year after year without human inputs. No one needs to fertilize the forest to get excellent plant growth, not even once. Seeing that answers all our questions about whether or not we need fertilizers. The answer is still unraveling as we learn more. It is truly a great time to be apart of food growth with new advancements discovered every day who knows what the future will hold.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thanks to dedicated individuals throughout the years we are now able to replicate some of those same symbiotic relationships in a pot. 
    <br>

  <h3>
    Mycellium:
  </h3>
  
    Further work and observation shows the importance of compost in these relationships. This has brought us to the reality that we can revitalize a field just as easily with compost tea and a sprayer as we can with fertilizer. The difference is that fertilizers have to be reapplied often. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Giving soil back its life is only required in monoculture practices. 
    <br>
    <br>
    With these new strategies in the field we are able to take some soil life and grow it over time using crop rotation and planting certain plant types. More research needed here.

  <h4>
    Compost tea:
  </h4>
    
    Compost tea is a brew made from a handful or two of <!--***-->good compost, placing that in a large barrel with water, some form of <!--***-->food for the microbes and letting that brew in the sun for a week or two. The result is a root innoculent that seeds soil life while vastly improving plant growth for a period of time afterwards.  
    <br>
    <br>
    Compost tea can be made cheeply, it costs significantly less than fertilizers and is sprayed just as easily using similar equipment.

  <h3>
    We all need food for life and health:
  </h3>
  
    Our deepest hope is that one day soon we will all live in a society where no one gets hungry unless they are fasting or for some other reason choose to do be hungry.
    <br>
    <br>
    Reality is that we can feed more people, in more areas of the globe, for less cost and we can do it for almost free all year round... even in areas like Edmonton.
  
  <h4>
    Yet hunger exists:
  </h4>
  
  Something like a <!--***-->billion people go hungry every day.
  
  <p>
    People should never be hungry!

    Growing locally can:
     <!--Might move this to Introduction page-->
  </h3>
  
<h4>
  Resources and shipping:
</h4>

    <ul>
      <b>Remove extra costs:</b>
      <br>
      <li><!--***-->Labour, <!--***-->refrigeration and <!--***-->energy at various <!--***-->warehouses outside of the local region, province, state and country, including <!--***-->loading and un loading at the <!--***-->shipyards.</li>
      <br>
      <li><!--***-->Trucking between those warehouses and shipyards.</li>
      <br>
      and
      <br>
      <br>
      <li><!--***-->Fuel required to drive all the trucks and <!--***-->equipment for loading and off loading, as well as the <!--***-->natural resources associated with building ships, equipment, <!--***-->containers, <!--***-->roads, <!--***-->etc.</li>
      <br>
      Using the resources we use locally and within a <!--***-->Country make sense because we need to get food to people's mouths from where it is grown, there's no doubt about that. However, the rest of it, for the most part is very unnecessary and <i>is</i> what adds significant costs to food when we are shopping at our local grocery store.
    </ul>
    
<h4>
  Typical greenhouses:
</h4>

  Growing locally in a greenhouse isn't much better either. Even though they don't have the above costs that most greenhouses have they have other costs such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Power.</li>
        <li>Gas (unless electric heat).</li>
        <li>Production gap to shutdown and startup seasonally = many unproductive months.</li>
        <li>Daytime cooling.</li>
        <li>Nighttime heating.</li>
        <li>Water.</li>
        <li>Fertilizer and renewing soil.</li>
        <li>Pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers,etc. When these are needed it is usually the whole room. Greenhouses are huge grow rooms. This = $$$ to knock down pests, moulds, etc., if or whenever it arises.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      These are huge see <!--***-->here.
      
  <p>
    Fortunately these are all removable costs with the right approach to greenhouse design. Please see project 1 below.

  <h3>
    Motivation:
  </h3>
  
    <ul>
      <li>I have been hungry before, it is not fun.</li>
      <li>I have seen ***hunger. This is worse.</li>
      <li>Experimentation <!--***-->growing cannabis led me to try those same techniques on food. I was awe struck at the results. So I am sharing. I hope to start a business growing food this way. If not, at least information is on the <i>big bad web</i> for everyone to see... lol;)</li>
      <br>
      Also:
      <br>
      <li><!--***-->Floods do not affect a <!--***-->greenhouse like they do an open field.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li><!--***-->Produce (healthy food) needs to be affordable to all people, all year, not just on grocery week.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Insurance costs go up after catastrophic loses further creatimg more costs.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li><!--***-->Food waste average in Canada is huge - over 60% from farm to fork. Most of this waste, about 90%, happens before the grocery store shelves. Meaning that between the farm (in a warm climate) and outside our local grocer (warehouse located close by) is where most waste occurs. It is a long journey with mamy stops along the way. The fewer stops there are, and the less number of days in transport (up to a <!--***-->week or more), the better the food will hold up which will result in more ending up at the store and less cost going in your belly. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In other words, long distance transportation is the leading cause to food waste. 
      <br>
      <br>
      If those numbers are accurate then regional food production, or even in country food production would greatly reduce waste by as much as 90%, maybe more.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Nevermind that the cost of energy constantly goes.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li><!--***-->Holland greenhouses are massive. Some areas it goes on for <!--***-->many kilometers. It is not insane to think that we can grow copius amounts of food under glass.
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Plant health is better becasue of UV light. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304423818300967" target="blank"> UV light. </a> UV is typical blocked with traditional greenhouse glazings. <!--***-->EFTE lets most UV through. ETFE is self cleaning, super light weighing 1/100th the weight of glass, and it never fades according to Japanese gardeners who have used <!--***-->ETFE on their greenhouses for over 30 years.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>A man in Nebraska grows Citrus year round for 50 cents a day. <!--***-->He mamages to keeps temperatures well over 20C all year and he does so by simply blowing air into weaping tile that collect residual thermal heat from in ground around his yard. See project 1 below for my version.</li>

<h3>
  Conclusion:
</h3>

Alegedly we lose up to 70% during shipping so they grow 70% more to account for those loses. This won't need to be true anymore if food is grown locally. Saving us space required to grow that same amount of food because the amount of space we will need to replace that production locally is significantly less. 50-70% less .

  Combined, these projects are able to bring food production closer to our grocery stores in several cost efficent ways. With strategy and technology combined we can reduce many costs, costs that were historically necessary for us to enjoy certain foods year round locally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Never before have we had this combination of technologies available to us. The ability for us to <!--***-->automate and <!--***-->monitor our gardens remotely is unparalleled thanks to COVID. Allowing individuals and families more freedom while reducing costs of labour and resources are certainly assets in some way.
    <br>
    <br>
    Additionally, well tested <!--***-->FTEF is available to glaze our greenhouses. At 1/100th the weight of glass we are able to build the greenhouse normally, as if it had to hold up all that glass and then use the ultra-light <!--***-->ETFE instead giving us immemse weight supporting potential. In turn we support rows of automated verticle rotation garden systems from the roof structure. Doing this will also give room for  extra rows of food in the ground underneath. Combined we can maximize food produced with free sunlight and can even be put these in normal greenhouses.
    <br>
    <br>
    The ability to produce food constantly means fewer months, if any, are spent not growing food for the market. This increases year end production significantly because 6 months aren't shut down for winter. Then seed in the spring and have to wait months to reap the benifits leaving upto 9 months a year not producing unless you use energy to spring and fall heat.
    <br>
    <br>
    On land water collection in hilly areas can save water in ponds and provide it for winter useage for the cost of pumping it.
    <br>
    <br>
    By allowing UV light in we have a naturally stabilized and sanitized grow environment.  Plants are able to protect themselves outside better for this reason and this is typically why infestations and other issues hit greenhouses in the first place, light filtration. 
    <br>
    <br>
    As we know with LEDs, better light means better plants. <!--***-->UV light is a natural sterilizer keeping our qir and water sterilized which we <!--***-->oxygenate to ensure optimal root zone health. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Living soil allows the roots to do what they are designed to do, support the plant. In nature this is automatic. Sadly for years we knew very little as to why this is the case. We now know that the roots <!--***-->communicate through <!--***-->mycelium
    <br>
    <br>
     They are able to warn other plants of disease and selectively grow their roots or not to allow better chance or not for other plants to take hold. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Roots send signals to microbes and through a complicated chain of interactions involving <!--***-->Humic and Fulvic acids, nutrints and water are express delivered through root membranes and into the plant. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Microbes breakdown dirt transforming unusable nutrients and minerals into everything a plant needs to defend it self, feed it self, and keep itself healthy. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Living soil is by far the most benifical. Although the magic truly happens when a person combines all these techniques together.
     <br>
     <br>
     Removing long distance shipping costs as much as possible is important in reducing food prices and reducing resource damands enough to matter. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Groceries account for more of our monthly purchase budget than almost any other item we buy in stores combined. It cost a ton to feed a family for the year. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Being able to grow plants with no worries for super cheap is critical for our futures... unless you want to <!--***-->eat bugs. I know I don't.
     <br>
     <br>
     Eggs, Chicken and milk are major sales items in grocery stores. Providing these closer helps saves money and resources also. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Creating farms that aren't in debt when a farmer starts production will greatly reduce food prices for lack of major overhead right from the start. A farm that starts out of debt and prices their food accordingly prices their food for way less because they won't have to reduce prices once the mortgage is paid off.
     <br>
     <br>
     Food systems that compliment each other are able to provide more cost savings on top of not needing external feed sources because these are purchases and that is money out thus cost added to food sale price.
     <br>
     <br>
     Closed-Loop production close to the mouths that eat is clear in in its advantages.
     <br>
     <br>
     We also can go verticle in southern windows of highrises. Knock out sections of floor near the widows and build the systems between a new wall and the glass keeping most of the office space available (able to see the plants through windows if desired). All while utilizing the huge area of south facing highrise windows and the sun they get. This even helps reduce summer cooling costs.
     <br>
     <br>
     I cant give any more details away without hindering my own business abilities.
     <br>
     <br>
     The rest of this site is an in depth look at all that I have said. I have more information as well as resources galore to help in many topics. Mostly food production and energy, also other things like website building, water pumping for free, electrical learing, free education resources, cources from major universities and colleges, addiction stuff, community stuff, and more.
