        <h3>
            Project vision:
        </h3>
        
    <p>
        To create a greenhouse system that allows for the growth of foods grown in warmer climates, foods typically grown tropically, subtropically, or temperate grown, and bring them into regions where these foods could never be grown. Like Edmonton, Alberta.

        <h3>
            Project goals:
        </h3>
        

    <p>
        <ol>
          <li>-Use solar ***thermal energy storage to create a year round equal growing climate.</li>
          <br>
          <li>-Use ***(fungus guy) mother ***nature (Natre magazine) as a ***teacher (David Suzuki- Nature of Things). Soil life ***matters (comparison of weed grown with and without supersoil), and so we try to replicate what she does in the wild into each and every garden pot we mix we make.</li>
          <br>
          <li>-Utilize glazing products (glass) that promote more of the ***suns rays (ETFE data) to penetrate. Being immensely ***lighter (more ETFE data) than glass and quite a bit lighter than various kinds of ***plastics (Chart comparing greenhouse glazing weights), ***ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) is by far one of the more superior choices for ***glazing a greenhouse. This is due to its properties as a ***greenhouse covering. it is ultra ***light (repeat link), ***self cleaning, able to be ***layered for insulating against the cold, as well as letting 99% of the suns ray ***spectrum in. Plants are used to being ***outside and grow best outside because of the suns rays. Pests that are an issue in greenhouses are an issue partly because of the fact that other glazings can block ***UVA, ***UVB, ***UBC (effects on plants), some combination of them or all of ***them (glazing data or chart or both on light passivity).</li>
          <br>
          <li>-We will utilize ***renewable energy and ***various energy ***storage methods. There is a whole section on this planned for down the road. Look for Energy further down. <b><u>(not yet. check back soon) </u></b></li>
          <br>
          <li>-Research and collect data on ***soil life (microscopes link), ***proliferation (stages of soil life book), ***sustainability (how to maintain soil life with molases and liquid karma), and what all of that does to ***plants (plant nutrient, as well as micro and macro nutrient requirement) exactly, as well as ***recording (sensors in dirt at farm in germany video) results and ***keeping microscope slides, ***photos, ***videos and ***measurements along the way.</li>
          <br>
          <li>-We hope to be able to provide this information for free on the internet. Hence the cheap ***HTML code (HTML coding video) website for now.</li>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>This will always remain free and never behind a pay wall.</li> 
            <br>
            <li>No gimmicks, or ploys to sell you stuff.</li>
            <br>
            <li>No email sign up required so you can access data.</li>
            <br>
            <li>You will see no sales being done here, nor will you see affiliate links or links I make money off of.</li> 
            <br>
            <li>I do not need to make money to share what I know with others as long as others are OK with free website skills.</li> 
            <br>
          </ul>
          
          <li>All lessons learned will be shared.</li>
          <br>
          <li>All data collected will be charted and presented. </li>
          <br>
          <li>Alongside results will be photos, ***videos (DaVinci-BlackMagic), ***charts (excel templates site) and what ever else we feel important that will make it easy for others to succeed in ***a garden (planning cheat sheet), ***a greenhouse (greenhouse blueprints), or to start their own ***agri-business ***growing food (show basement microgreens production video).</li>

        <h3>
            Customers and Delivery:
        </h3>
    
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Many grocers around here accept locally grown foods, we plan to hit a niche market that is pretty dead locked on its prices and quite simply everyone eats. Ever further still, fresh and local is a chiice people rather make especially if it is not more money like most organic... I cant figure out why "organic" has come to meam "more expensive".</li>
        <br>
        <li>Since we will be able to sell at a much lower rate than what it costs to plant, grow, be picked, get trucked, be stored, then shipped 10,000km, stored again in seacans in a shipyard, then trucked again to a warehouse,  from the warehouse - trucked again to stocks in your store and then to the grocery shelves. That is alot of steps to the local store. Anything grown locally and for only the costs of labour and local shipping has got to be less expensive than what it takes to do the same farm labour add all those steps in between going to the same store that for me is max a couple hundred kilometers away.</li>
        <br>
        <li>There are also Farmers Markets as an alternative.</li>
        <br>
        <li>As a last resort, a highway stand or parkinglot thing are options.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Finally, our on line presences. I plan to do a fair bit of marketing once I am able to hire a marketer. As well as get an app built for home delivery, or on site specific pickup.</li> 
        <br>
        <li>The ultimate end goal would be to have as much automated as possible as well as having some sort of drone delivery that enables from farm to fork implementation and a person wouldn't even have to leave their house.</li>

        <h3>
            Motivation:
        </h3>
    
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>All of our tropical / subtropical foods ***travels about 10,000 km or more to reach Canada.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Most freight croses the ocean to get here making the most economical transport a ***massive container ship. These ships burn ***immense volumes of fuel. For a 100,000 ***TEU (20 foot equivalent units. Meaning 100,000 20foot seacans can fit on one vessel) burns _______***tons of fuel. One ton equals ____*** number of liters.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Food costs in remote regions like ***Northwest Territories or ***Nunuvit are enormous, any food production system that allows food to be grown further north may be able to mitigate their food cost burden greatly, if this design is proven useful here.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Drake *** Landing in Alberta shows the potential of solar thermal storage.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Water can be pumped up hill for free with a ***ram pump allowing for some areas to take advantage of hills to collect water and pump it to a greenhouse for zero pennies a liter.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Mutart *** Conservatory showcases a variety of plants being growth under glass year round in Edmonton. Further highlighting the reality of the incredible variety of plants that can be grown this far north.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Soil Companies like ***Gaia and ***Fox Farms exist which pre mix very useful soil combinations making soil purchase easy. *** Subcools super soil is another way to learn how to make your own if you desire.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Greenhouses in ***Holland show that it is not far out idea to do massive production indoors.</li> 
        <br>
        <li>Verticle ***Farms show that you can go up alot and with the massive reduction of weight gained by ETFE, one can now habg alot of plants off of the building structure without need for heavier engineering in the building design.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the ***guy in Olds from above and you get more proof that a greenhouse in Alberta can maintain year round conditions that are adequate for year round plant growth of plants that demand higher year round lower temperatures.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Olds ***college shows excellent proof of plant water filtering abilities.</li>
      </ol>
