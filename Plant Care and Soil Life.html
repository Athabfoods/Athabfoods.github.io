        <p>
        There is much to learn in order to grow a bountiful garden easily, with no headaches.
        </p> 
        <p>
        Doing it extraordinary requires dedication to observe closely plants and general life of your garden and to take measurements periodically and then to slowly adjust over some years. 
        </p>
        <p>
        To do that one should understand most of the following topics:

            Something I have come to appreciate about plants is that the healthier they are the less you have to worry about pests, growth issues, fertilizers, pH-ing, or watering <a href="https://bloomscape.com/plant-care/telltale-signs-of-overwatered-plants-according-to-plant-mom/" target=""blank"> too much </a> or <a href="https://bloomscape.com/plant-care/help-am-i-overwatering-or-underwatering-my-plant/" target=""blank"> too little </a>.

        Soil and plant production:
        </h2>
         
        <p>
            Where does plant health come from?
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Some say it comes from <a href="https://byjus.com/biology/fertilizers/#:~:text=Fertilisers%20are%20mainly%20classified%20into,types%2C%20organic%20and%20inorganic%20fertilisers." target=""blank"> fertilizer </a> while others say the <a href="https://www.cannagardening.com/inert_substrates_general_info#:~:text=The%20substrate%2C%20or%20growing%20medium,%2Dto%2Dwaste%20and%20recirculation." target=""blank"> soil </a>. 
            
            <br>
            In a way, both are correct however, fertilizer is simply nutrients extracted from something else and nutrients can be extracted from soil by <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/introduction-to-microbiology/0/steps/51408#:~:text=Current%20estimates%20suggest%20there%20could,Archaea%2C%20Fungi%2C%20and%20Protists." target=""blank"> microorganisms</a> like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode" target=""blank"> nemotodes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa" target=""blank"> protozoa</a>, and the <a href="https://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/SAG-16" target=""blank">likes </a>(This is very imprtant information for understanding soil Microbes and Nutrient Recycling, from Ohio State University). 
          </p>
          
          <p>
          This type of soil has many names; <a href="https://lomi.com/blogs/news/what-is-living-soil?nbt=nb%3Aadwords%3Ax%3A20199478977%3A%3A&nb_adtype=&nb_kwd=&nb_ti=&nb_mi=&nb_pc=&nb_pi=&nb_ppi=&nb_placement=&nb_si={sourceid}&nb_li_ms=&nb_lp_ms=&nb_fii=&nb_ap=&nb_mt=&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYjQgd6OgAMVyQetBh1aUwFZEAMYASAAEgKy7vD_BwE&campaignid=20199478977&adgroupid=&targetid=&creative=&network=x&device=c&utm_source=google" target=""blank"> Living </a> Soil, Veganic Soil, <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/subcools-super-soil-step-by-step/" target=""blank"> Supersoil </a>, <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/biodiversity/mycorrhizal-fungi" target=""blank"> Mycorrhizal Fungi (IMPORTANT) </a> and Soil, Substrate, <a href="https://www.hgtv.com/outdoors/gardens/planting-and-maintenance/how-to-amend-garden-soil" target=""blank"> Amended Soil </a>, among some names. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In a way the soil is fertilizer because the plants health comes from the fact that the soil is digested by microbe life and the dirt it self is the food for that life.
            <br>
            Intrestingly enough, most soils that are producing poorly are not in need of amending but instead just in need of having microbe life revitalized. 
          <br>
          Why does soil become life less over time? <a href="https://eos.com/blog/monoculture-farming/" target=""blank"> Monoculture (IMPORTANT). </a>

        <p>
            Over the years I have tried many ***soil amendment (GAIA) ***recipes and ***combinations.
          <br>
          From very ***complicated mixes to simply adding ***one, ***two, or a ***few certain products and mixing it with normal outside ***field dirt. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
          I have discovered have some very impactful things while experimenting last year. More testing is needed, but if those results are accurate, ... my oh my ... what a potential to the future of food production that will be!
        </p>
        
        <p>              
          As you can see, growing food takes alot of dedication to do so in a truly ***sustainable (deffintion) way. I am one who has been taking on this challenge for years. I plan to continue my journey in the garden commercially one day with this ***system (flow chart) I ***designed (my drawings) first, then with the projects below... hopefully :)
