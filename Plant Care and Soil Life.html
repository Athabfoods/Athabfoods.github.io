    <p>
      There is much to learn in order to grow a bountiful garden easily and with no headaches.
    </p> 
        
      Doing it extraordinary requires dedication to observe closely your plants and the life in your garden. To also take measurements periodically and then to slowly adjust over some years to come. 
 
  <p>
    To do that one should understand most of the following topics:

        <li>Plant growth condition requirements like soil type, how much to water, fertilizer suplements, amount of sunlight, suseptability to rot, does it attract pests or benificals, how to mitigate pest attractors, etc. are all discoverable on line with a quick search. Make sure to have plant species and your question, find a reliable source and go with it.

      <li>fertilizers,</li>

    Soil health and plant production:
  </h3>
         
    <p>
      Where does plant health come from?
    </p>
       
    Some say it comes from <a href="https://byjus.com/biology/fertilizers/#:~:text=Fertilisers%20are%20mainly%20classified%20into,types%2C%20organic%20and%20inorganic%20fertilisers." target=""blank"> fertilizer </a> while others say the <a href="https://www.cannagardening.com/inert_substrates_general_info#:~:text=The%20substrate%2C%20or%20growing%20medium,%2Dto%2Dwaste%20and%20recirculation." target=""blank"> soil </a>. 
      <br>
      <br>
    In a way, both are correct however, fertilizer is simply nutrients extracted from something else and nutrients can be extracted from soil by <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/introduction-to-microbiology/0/steps/51408#:~:text=Current%20estimates%20suggest%20there%20could,Archaea%2C%20Fungi%2C%20and%20Protists." target=""blank"> microorganisms</a> like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode" target=""blank"> nemotodes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa" target=""blank"> protozoa</a>, and the <a href="https://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/SAG-16" target=""blank">likes </a>(This is very imprtant information for understanding soil Microbes and Nutrient Recycling, from Ohio State University). 
        <br>
        <br>
    This type of soil has many names; <a href="https://lomi.com/blogs/news/what-is-living-soil?nbt=nb%3Aadwords%3Ax%3A20199478977%3A%3A&nb_adtype=&nb_kwd=&nb_ti=&nb_mi=&nb_pc=&nb_pi=&nb_ppi=&nb_placement=&nb_si={sourceid}&nb_li_ms=&nb_lp_ms=&nb_fii=&nb_ap=&nb_mt=&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYjQgd6OgAMVyQetBh1aUwFZEAMYASAAEgKy7vD_BwE&campaignid=20199478977&adgroupid=&targetid=&creative=&network=x&device=c&utm_source=google" target=""blank"> Living </a> Soil, Veganic Soil, <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/subcools-super-soil-step-by-step/" target=""blank"> Supersoil </a>, <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/biodiversity/mycorrhizal-fungi" target=""blank"> Mycorrhizal Fungi (IMPORTANT) </a> and Soil, Substrate, <a href="https://www.hgtv.com/outdoors/gardens/planting-and-maintenance/how-to-amend-garden-soil" target=""blank"> Amended Soil </a>, among some names. 
   <p>
    In a way the soil is fertilizer because the plants health comes from the fact that the soil is digested by microbe life and the dirt it self is the food for that life.
            <br>
            <br>
    Intrestingly enough, most soils that are producing poorly are not in need of amending but instead just in need of having microbe life revitalized. 
            <br>
            <br>

    Over the years I have tried many ***soil amendment (GAIA) ***recipes and ***combinations.
          <br>
          <br>
    From very ***complicated mixes to simply adding ***one, ***two, or a ***few certain products and mixing it with normal outside ***field dirt.
          <br>
          <br>
    I have discovered some very impactful things while experimenting last year. However, more testing is needed, but if those results are accurate, ... my oh my ... what a great thing for food production that will be!
          <br>
          <br>
    As you can see, growing food takes alot of dedication to do so in a truly ***sustainable (deffintion) way. 
          <br>
          <br>
    I have been taking on this challenge for years and I plan to continue my journey in the garden commercially with this ***system (flow chart) I ***designed (my drawings) first, then with more. Like a closed loop way to produce chickens, fish and produce which makes its own electricity also. One rural and another urban that compliment each other but these will be done as a ***habitat for humanity initiative, providing willing familes already integrated food production businesses for them to take over and not worry because all the kinks are worked out.
