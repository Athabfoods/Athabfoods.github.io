  <h3>
    Shopping and shipping:
  </h3>
  
 <p>
    Think about how much you buy in a store. 
    <br>
    When you shop, what are you normally shopping for? Food!
  </p>
    
      We go to the store many more times for food then we do for furnature, clothes, dishes, vehicles, insurace, school stuff, etc. Yes some of those things cost more, thats not the point. 
      <br>
      <br>
      What I am saying is that the largest volume of products that gets moved around globally IS food. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In a month, we buy 2-3 meals a day, on average and for 30 days (hopefully). 
      <br>
      <br>
      In that same month you may buy clothes or shoes or a piece of furniture. However the likely hood that you buy 10 of those things a week is just not there... usually. 
      <p>
      This means that of what is shipped globally, volume wise, at least 60% of it is food, maybe more. 
      </p>
      
<hr>      
      
  <h3> 
    Food needs unfrozen land to grow:
  </h3>
      
      This is why for us in Canada, much of it is grown  in the South. 
      <p>
        In fact, looking at a ***map we can see that much of Earth's land mass is in the North. The further North you go the wider and denser the land gets, also, the colder it gets.
        </p>
    
        Meaning that food has the most land to grow on ONLY in places that get cold enough every year to hault major plant production. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Of the land that does grow food year round. Places like South America, South Africa, and South China (our bigger global producers) are either crowded with people, dense jungle (which should be protected), too mountainous, not very wide East to West, or usually some combo. 
      <br>
      
<hr>
      
  <h3>
    Shipping and inflation:
  </h3>
      
      <p>Something has to give, right? This model of ***product distribution. With ships that burn an incredible 300 tons of fuel every single day.
      </p>
      <i>Please note that </i><br><i>300 tons is equal to 600,000</i> <b><u>pounds</u> of fuel</b> 
      <u>(depending on the ton you use)</u>. 
      <p>
        <b>Yes... 600,000 pounds EVERY SINGLE DAY.</b> 
        <br>
        <br>
        For ONE ship.
      </p>
        
        AND (the nerdy part is) these ships typically take 10 - 14 day long trips... one way...
      
        <br>
        <br>
        Apperently this is the most efficient and economical way to transport cargo. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Why?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
       
       Fuel tank volume vs the ships ***TEU capacity vs the output of the chosen engine vs how much money they can make per run because of fuel tank volume impacting shipable cargo capicity.

<hr>
    
  <h3>
    Something to think about:
  </h3>
 
        A ten day journey means that 6 million pounds of fuel gets burnt... this is a bad thing... that is 3000 tons btw.
        <br>
        <br>
        Again. This os only one ship.
      <p>
        Between the 10 largest shipping corporations there are well over 30,000 ships globally. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Not all of them burns 300 tons a day, some more, some less.
      </p>
      
          IMPORTANT - 
          <br>
          Even if these 30,000 ships only burnt through 100 tons each a day, then on average this still means that 3 million tons are burnt every single day between these 10 larges companies. Unfortunately this is not the case, I said 300 tons a day because that is just over my estimated avearge based on my research last year. Lowest average is 200 tons a day but could be upwards of 350 tons also, it was hard to calculate because I had difficulty finding acurate numbers that I could trust.
          <br>
          <br>
          Also keep in mind that this is ONLY for the 10 largest commpanies globally. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>There are more companies befoe you hit a hundred which I am certain are equally matched innships, if not having more than the largest ten, hard to say because data was rare at best!</b>
          
<hr>
          
  <h3>
    Other things that effect our food quality and price:
  </h3>
         
      Fertilizers and pesticides are obviously absorbed by the plants a bit and some of that gets into food. That means some organic is actually yuck! Nevermind what they do to the land over the years.
 
<hr>
      
  <h3>
    Ukraine and energy:
  </h3>
  
        After seeing the energy crisis in Ukraine I decided to give all extra power that is not needed by the company to grow food back to the grid for free. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This will help reduce local resident's energy costs because the grid operator will not have to produce the energy themselves... 
  <p>
      Simply stated!
      <br>
      We are not selling energy that is made by nature. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Not ever! 
  </p>
  
<hr>
  
  <h3>
   Why can we afford to be so generous?: 
  </h3>
  
    There are many aspects to our portfolio. By the end of 10 years we will have implemented and tested close to as many projects. 
    <br>
    <br>
    If all are a success then we will have created close to ten companies that produce food and all people. 
    <br>
    <br>
      
    Once the equipment is paid for it doesn't matter any more because any corporation with multiple subsidiaries is able to give back more. Most do down the road, we plan on doing it from the get go.
 
      <br>
      <br>
        Why?
      <br>
      <br>
  
      When you are able to grow food in ways that are self supprting and you are no longer worried about re occuring costs. Overhead goes to a minimum which means more can be done to offer customers better value and reduced costs as well as maintin things during economic struggle and downturn. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Removing huge reccuring costs also means that laying people off is a thing of the past during bust cycles.
      
<hr>
      
  <h3>
    Recurring costs:
  </h3>
  
      The following costs are reduced significantly or removed completely with a well planned out food greenhouse.
  
      <ul>
        <li>soil recouping with</li> 
        <li>fertilizers</li>and
        <li>pest control</li> and 
        <li>water</li> and 
        <li>electricity</li> for
        <li>heating</li>and 
        <li>cooling</li> plus the 
        <li>labour costs for the time it takes to water</li> and the 
        <li>cost of the water</li>, etc.
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        All these cost listed above are enormous when added up.
      </p>
      
      Imagine if those savings were used to pay off the building quicker, or pay better wages, or keep people employed during downturn, or selling produce for falf price of competition, or building dozens upon dozens of locations to help more people eat and be employed, or many of thoses things...
      
<hr>    
      
  <h3>
    My design:
  </h3>
      
      The design takes care of all of that. Profits can be focused on what matters. Like sharing what we learn openly and freely, once we have what works established and record it to share. It will be much easier for others to want to take the cost plunge investing their money, effort, and time on something when they know the results already. 
      <br>
      <br>
      From my last ten years of experimenting on cannabis, more recently on food, I am certain that this is not the case. This is more than worth our time and money which is why the entire websote that follows exists, to show countless examples and resources on top of my own word that it works.
      <br>
      <br>
      Combining many small tweaks in the garden has a compounding effect on food growth.
      <br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately I was never legally allowed to grow production quantity cannabis, only personal medical. Otherwise I could vouch for the ability to scale up. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Many people I ended up selling it to though because I was asked too much to say no. Their words are: "the best tasting weed that gets you baked as f***"... I have been told this in many ways over the years.

<hr>    
    
  <h3>
    Winter and food growth:
  </h3>
  
  Food can not grow when the ground is frozen, that is a fact. This is probably the biggest contributor to food costs globally, hands down. 
  <p>
  Greenhouse growing is even more expensive the further north you go. This is due to cold winters combined with heating costs, the longer and more bitter the winter, ie: the further north you go, the more hours of night you see which meams you will have to spend more to heat a greenhouse. 
  <br>
  <br>
  This makes producing food year round in a greenhouse unfeasible and thus a southern thing. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Or a very expensive thing if choosing to do so and that is because of greenhouse design NOT location. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Greenhouses are designed to grow as many square feet of food as posible under one glass roof so their design is often a huge rectangular building.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is great for summer sollar gain and equally as awesome at losing heat at night and in the winter. Not so good at keeping the food costs down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the costs of energy keep on the rise, we have a recipe for food poverty that keeps growing.
  </p>
  
  <hr>
  <hr>
  
  <h3>
    We can do something about it though, right?
  </h3>
  
  Yes we can! 
  <br>
  <br>
  As I was saying... it is as much about design as it is about technology. And those two equal the importance of understanding soil science and more specifically, living soils and substrates. 
  <br>
  Combined I feel that they have the potential to offer us a financially sound way of long term food production in countless regions.
  
<hr>
  
  <h3>
    How many ways can food be grown sustainably?
  </h3>
  
  
    The crazy part is that I think that not only can we grow food sustainably, we can produce food in a closed loop facility that does not require feedstock inputs nor does it require power or gas from the grid. See below for more on project 3. And on 'Home - Index' page under 'Projects' then 'Chilopoda Farms' for all the details (under construction still). 

<hr>
  
  <h3>
    Breif overview of projects:
  </h3>
  
  
  Project 1, the greenhouse proves soil science plus that the glazing is adequate and does as expected, and that the automations are efficent and accurate as well. This is for placing in tight situations and producing food with diverse applications and can be built almost any where there is southerly sun exposure. We are proving what can be grown this far north and for how much more of the season also. We are showing soil revitalization as well as how the life looks under microscope. We are studying the long effects of spil life on food growth and if all discovered things are long term reliable. We are showcasing energy cost savings due to design and recording 24/7 hourly temperature records as well as recording residual in ground heat gain over the years. We hope to integrate auto watering based on a sensor array to effectively use water. We hope to design and start testing farm to fork drone delivery after 5 years of working out the kinks. Among other things. See Projects page for more (linked at bottom).
  <br>
  <br>
  Project 2, creates an inportant feed stream for the closed-loop production facility. This step is required in order to make step three 98% viable. Project 2 is a turn-key type operation that irons out all the kinks and integrates priducts into their sales stream before the customer takes over. Customers walk into a well oiled machine, already funtioning, already established businss with retail established so that they can become farmer with minimal training and almost guaranteed no failure anxiety as long as they continue what was started. Designed for both new customers or for those trying to expand their operations in a sustainable way.  Our system is to be automated with automatic logistics dispatching, automatic animal husbandry and harvesting machinery, auto packaging and storage, auto rotation of animals outside, automatic everything that can be. The goal is to produce eggs and milk regionally at hundreds of mini farms closer to large  urban centers, collected, pasteurized and packaged centrally them locally distributed to reduce shipping impact and costs as well as to confirm a couple aspects of the next project. We intend to pay for the first farm and then the next two farmd with the first one. When that is done we give away the first like habitat for humanity does. The next two are paid for too so we run those next two until they pay for two more each, we now have 7 paid for, one sold so we sell the next two leaving four paid for. Now we use those four to pay for 8 and when done we give away the 4 in the same fashion as well. We take the 8 paid for to make 16 and then the 16 paid for to pay for 32 and each time we give the previous group away. This way we never lose money and promote farming in one move. This gives skeptical individuals a reason to produce food (it is already established) and allows them to do so without debt which is another cause of food inflation. These are for within 100-200km of large city centers. The average jersey cow produces about 30 liters a day. This means that 50 cows produce about 1500 liters a day. That is 547,000 liters a year = 273,750 containers of 2 liter milk or 136,875 @ 4 liters each. That is $1,231,875 and $821,250 respectively (at the store price. Of course you don't get that as a farmer. Point is that cow milk has a large rate of return which maximizes rate at which a farm can be paid off. This is what makes this idea work. The ability to pay off the whole thing with minimal labour so that it can benifit a family or someone who wants to work). We will also provide training so that being uneducated is not a barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Project 3 is the closed-loop facility as described above. We need to R and D this to iron out the bugs as is expected when putting several processes together. We are designing this for cookie cutter implementation and to both support and be supported by project 2. This is project twos urban counterpart and can be fitter to old warehouses, malls, or old store fronts for a diverse set food production potentials in the city. The design is scalable and will need to ne worked out. Eaxh facility is closer to the mouths it feeds producing chickens, fish, produce, composts, animal feeds, and at least its own energy. This will be owned by those who build it and help work out the kinks at each locations We are parting with 70-80% of the shares in a way that is similar to franchising. This is for quality control and to maintain the agreement with cows and chickens, as they compliment each other. (Same 70-80% share transfer to customer for that project as well).
  <br>
  <br>
      In fact, this has the potenial to produce plenty of energy it self... 
      <br>Along side: 
    <ul>
      <li>chickens - boilers and hens</li>
      <li>2 fish species, possibly more</li>
      <li>plants of various types</li>
      <li>and a few other things as well</li>
    </ul>
    
 
   <p>
    Again, that is closed-loop system to produce food. It has nothing coming into the building at all. My research is based on various literature resources that show specific stages of this design but seperatly as shorter processes.
    </p>
    
    I have combined several already practices and combined them creating a chain that, if the literature is accurate, allows us to produce food, electricity and the feed stock as well, all of it starts very simply too (trade secret for now). 
    <br>
    <br>
    Furthermore, the most serious wastes are mitigated by  processed that creates two or three useful and saleable products (depending on what kind of processing is set up) - regardless, one of which is used to support the process as well. 
    <br>
    <br>
    So you have a by product that can be fed back into the system at an early stage to allow for even further efficency... once it gets going.
    
<br>
<br>
    Project 4 is to create needed energy on site. We intend to test several designs of energy storage north of Edmonton (for viability) as wel as test various energy production methods and hopefully experiment with other potentials as well. Being we are so far north, using solar may make sense in the summer but it certainly doesn't make semse in the winter when there is only 5-7 hours of sunlight a day, the rest is night. Other ideas include hydrogen genration units, fuel cells, heat engines, heat pumps, gravity fed turbines fed for free water from a ***ram pump, using sound to split water, turbine generation, collecting energy from the air, and a few others as well. We want to see if simply combining existing generation technologies is sufficient to be a solution or if it takes more sources to become viable this far north.

  Everything I have talkd about and will mention on this page is verifiable on line. I also have compiled many resources on this site. That link is atthe bottom and will contain hundreds of resourcs by the time I am done. I wish to educate with reliable facts that are tested myself. These were my resources to learn or they are similar to what I learnt in the cases where I can not find the originals.

  <h3>
    I'm confused, if we can grow food for way less than why do we pay so much?
  </h3>
    
  
  
  <i>That</i>, my good friend, is an excellent question.
  

  <p>
    Will food ever cost less?
  </p>
  
  
    Maybe...
    <br>
    I mean, hopefully, if I have anything to do about it then yes. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Truthfully though, I don't know. Honestly I am worried that this reality will be quited just like it has been for so many others over the decades that this has been said over and over again. 
  
  
    Here's what I do know though. I know that we our selves are all that we can trust for bringing change to our own lives. We have waited on the government for way too long to do something good for us with no avail.
    <br>
    <br>
    They have their hands full trying to do other things, like run countries. Which is fine. 
    
  <p>
      What is not fine however, is that people are hungry and food grows for free.
  </p>
    
<hr>    
    
  <h3> 
    Municipal governments, our streets and hunger:
  </h3>
    
    
    Think about this. If cities planted food in their boulevards, like berry and fruit bushes, and they did that for one out of every 10 trees that they planted back when they built our strees... today there would be hundreds of thousands, probably millions of food producing trees and shrubs spread accross countless streets in various towns, villages, cities, and urban areas...
    <br>
    <br>
    What then? 
    <br>
    <br>
    Don't you think that some, if not many of the millions of hungry people would be less hungry?
    <br>
    <br>
    Fact is that the money was spent buying those trees anyways... so why not have spent it on food plants that can feed citizens?!?

  <p>
      Like I was saying, clearly if we are going to get help it ain't coming from them...
  </p>
  
<hr>  
  
  <h3>
    Expecting our government to help us:
  </h3>
  
  
     Sadly, it us that must take the initiative if we ever hope to see things get better.

<hr>  
  
  <h3>
    My opinion:
  </h3>
  
  <p>
  I think we can reduce the majority of our costs easily, while upholding to organic standards, ALL WHILE reducing environmental impact significantly.
