  <h3>
    Shopping and shipping:
  </h3>
  
 <p>
    Think about how much you buy in a store. 
    <br>
    When you shop, what are you normally shopping for? Food!
  </p>
    
      We go to the store many more times for food then we do for furnature, clothes, dishes, vehicles, insurace, school stuff, etc. Yes some of those things cost more, thats not the point. 
      <br>
      <br>
      What I am saying is that the largest volume of products that gets moved around globally IS food. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In a month, we buy 2-3 meals a day usually for 30 days (hopefully). This = 60-90 meals per person per month. The average meal may be from $3 - $5 which = $270 - $450 per month per person for 3 meals a day. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In that same month you may buy clothes or shoes or a piece of furniture too. However the likely hood that you buy 10 of those items a week is usually not there, when it is it only happens once in a while. 
      <p>
      This means that out of what is shipped globally, volume wise, at least 60% of it is food... maybe more. 
      </p>
      
      
<hr>      
      
  <h3> 
    Food needs unfrozen land to grow:
  </h3>
      
      This is why for us in Canada, much of our food is either grown South or in greenhouses locally. 
      <p>
        Its no wonder too. Looking at a ***map we can see that much of Earth's land mass is in the North and that the further North you go the wider and denser the land gets. Unfortunately this also means the colder it gets too.
        </p>
    
        Since food has the most land to grow on ONLY in places that get cold enough every year to hault major plant production. Without a new approach, we will likely suffer food inflation for years to come.
      <br>
      <br>
      Out of the land that does grow food year round. South America, South Africa, and South China (our biggest global producers) are either crowded with people, have dense jungles (which should be protected), are too mountainous, or are not very wide from East to West. Although usually it is some combination of the above making it rather difficult to want to rely on that for the long term.
      <br>
      <br>
      
<hr>
      
  <h3>
    Shipping and inflation:
  </h3>
      
      <p>Something has to give, right? This model of ***product distribution. With ships that burn an incredible 300 tons of fuel every single day.
      </p>
      <i>Please note that </i><br><i>300 tons is equal to 600,000</i> <b><u>pounds</u> of fuel</b> 
      <u>(depending on the ton you use)</u>. 
      <p>
        <b>That's 600,000 pounds EVERY SINGLE DAY.</b> 
        <br>
        <br>
        For ONE SHIP.
      </p>
        
        AND these ships typically take 10 - 14 day long trips... one way...
      <br>
      <br>

<hr>
    
  <h3>
    Something to think about:
  </h3>
 
        A ten day journey is at least 6 million pounds of fuel burning... that is 3000 tons.
        <br>
        <br>
        Again. This is only for one ship.
        
      <p>
        
        Furthermore, the 10 largest shipping corporations globally have more than 30,000 ships. Here is a map of worldwide <a href="https://www.shipxplorer.com/@34.15988,-110.25580,z3" target="blank">active ships right now</a>.
  
      </p>
      
          IMPORTANT - 
          <br>
          <br>
    Even if these 30,000 ships only burn through 100 tons each a day, then on average this still means that 3 million tons are burnt every single day between these 10 largest companies alone.
    <br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately this is not the case, it is between 200 - 300 tons a day on average per ship of the 10 largest freight liners makong it 6-9 million tons of ***bunker fuel per day are burnt.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>There are many more companies before you get to a hundred and there must be more than 100 shipping companies globally.</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          
<hr>
          
  <h3>
    Other things that effect our food quality and price:
  </h3>
         
      Fertilizers and pesticides are extra costs. They are surely absorbed by the plants a little bit thus getting into our food and bodies.
      <br>
      <br>
 
<hr>
      
  <h3>
    Ukraine and energy:
  </h3>
  
        After seeing the energy crisis in Ukraine I decided that if power production is feasible (legally), all extra power generated will be given to the grid for free. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This will help reduce energy costs locally because the grid operator will not have to produce that energy themselves... 
  <p>

      We are never going to sell energy that is made by nature. 

  </p>
  <br>
  
<hr>
  
  <h3>
   Why can we afford to be so generous?: 
  </h3>
  
    There are many aspects to this. At the end of 10 years we will have tested and worked out the bugs of more than 5 projects that are well researched. 
    <br>
    <br>
    If we are successful we will have created half a dozen conpanies that produce food for as close to free as possible. The location of the tests, if successful, will make further implementation able to be closer to where people live in the north. 
    <br>
    <br>
      
    And once the equipment is paid for, overhead drops to a low amount.

      <br>
      <br>
  
      When you are able to grow food in ways that are self supprting and you are no longer worried about re occuring costs. Overhead goes to a minimum which means more can be done to offer customers better value and reduced costs. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Also, by removing huge reccuring costs it is easier to keep people employed during recession cycles.
      <br>
      <br>
      
<hr>
      
  <h3>
    Recurring costs:
  </h3>
  
      The following costs are reduced significantly or completely with a well planned out food system.
  
      <ul>
        <li>shipping costs</li>
        <li>replacement soil</li> 
        <li>fertilizers</li>
        <li>pest controls</li> 
        <li>water</li>
        <li>electricity</li> for
        <li>heating</li>and 
        <li>cooling</li>
        <li>labour costs for the time it takes to water</li> and the 
        <li>cost of the water</li>
        <li>etc</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Costs listed above are enormous when added up.
      </p>
      
      Imagine if those savings were used to:
    <ul>
      <li>pay off the building quicker</li> 
      <li>pay better wages</li> 
      <li>keep people employed during downturn</li>
      <li>sell produce for half price of the competition</li> 
      <li>build dozens of locations quicker to help more people be able to eat and be employed</li>
      <li>other things</li>
    </ul>
         <br>
      
<hr>    
      
  <h3>
    Design:
  </h3>
      
      Design takes care of all of that. Profits can be focused on what matters. Like sharing what we learn openly and freely. Once we have what works established and recorded it to share. 
      <br>
      <br>
      It will be much easier for others to want to pay the cost of investing their money, effort, and time on something becasue they know it will work becasue the results are known before hand. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Combining natural growth factors in the garden has a compounding effect on quality food growth.
      <br>
      <br>
  
  <hr>

  <h3>
    How many ways can food be grown sustainably?
  </h3>
  
  
    The crazy part is that I think that not only can we grow food sustainably, we can produce food in closed loop facilities that do not require feedstock inputs nor do they require power or gas from the grid becasue they use cogeneration fueld from ***bio digesting (german garbage trucks) its own waste. 
    <br>
    <br>
    See next section for more on project 3.
    <br>
    <br>

<hr><>
  
  <h3>
    Breif overview of projects:
  </h3>
  
  
  <h4>Project 1</h4> 
  This greenhouse will prove soil science plus that chosen glazing is adequate and does as expected. That the automations are efficent and accurate as well. Design is for producing food in diverse applications and can be built almost any where there is southerly sun exposure. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Even though many examples exist for subtropical and tropical plant growth locally we are proving that food can be grown this far north too. And that we can do so for much more of the year. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We are showing soil revitalization techniques as well as how that soil life looks like under microscope. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We are studying and measuring the long term effects of soil life on food growth and if it is as viable as discovered so far. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We are showcasing energy cost savings due to design.
  <br>
  <br>
  We will document inside hourly temperatures records as well as recording residual in ground temperatures and heat gain over the years. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We hope to integrate auto watering based on a sensor array to effectively use water. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We hope to design and test farm to fork drone delivery systems after 5 years. 
  <br>
  Among other things.
  <br>
  <br>
<hr>

  <h4>Project 2</h4>
  Creates an inportant feed stream for the closed-loop production facility (project 3). This step is required along side the greenhouse in order to make Chilopoda Farms 98% viable. 
  <br>
  <br>Project 2 (C&C Farms) is a turn-key type operation that irons out all the kinks of automated milk and egg production, storing and logistics to retail. 
  <br>
  <br>We integrate into retail and iron out all the bugs before the customer takes over so customers walk into a well oiled, already funtioning, already established business so that they can become farmer with minimal training and almost guaranteed no failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Designed for both new customers or those trying to expand their operations in a sustainable way.  
  <br>
  <br>
  Fully automatic logistics dispatching, automatic animal husbandry, automatic product collection, automatic harvesting, auto packaging and storage, auto rotation of animal paddocks outside, automatic everything that can be. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The goal is to produce eggs and milk regionally at hundreds of mini farms closer to large  urban centers, collect it, pasteurize it and package it all centrally to be locally distributed.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is to reduce shipping impact costs as well as to confirm a couple aspects for the next project. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We intend to pay for the first farm and the next two with the first one. When that is done we give away the first one like habitat for humanity does. The next two are now paid for so we run those two until they pay for four more (or two more each). 
  <br>
  We give #2 and #3 away keeping 4,5,6 and 7 until they pay for two more each. When those 8 are paid we give the 4 away leaving 8 to pay for 16, when done we give the 8 away. Then 16 pays for 32 and we give the 16 away. 32 pays for 64 and we give away 32... and so on and so forth until hundreds exist around multiple cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  This way we never lose money and promote farming all in one move. 
  <br>
  <br>
  This gives skep<>tical individuals a reason to produce food as it is already established and allows them to do so without debt which is another cause of food inflation. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Design is for within 100-200km of city centers. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The average jersey cow produces about 30 liters a day. This means that 50 cows produce about 1500 liters a day. That is about 547,000 liters a year = 273,750 2L containers of milk or 136,875 @ 4 liters each. 
  <br>
  That equals $1,231,875 and $821,250 respectively (at store price). 
  Of course you don't get that as a farmer but the point is that cow milk has a very large rate of return which maximizes rate at which a farm can be paid off. 
  <br>
  <br>
  This is what makes this idea work. The ability to pay off the whole thing with minimal labour so that it can benifit other families or people who want to work on a farm. We will also provide training so that being uneducated is not a barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  R and D part is required to make the milk and egg collection area modular for easy drop and if things don't work out at that site, it is not a complete loss, just remove the buildings and bring them to a new site.
  <br>
<hr>
  
  <h4>Project 3</h4> 
  Closed-loop food production facility, as described above. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Major R and D to iron out the bugs that are expected when putting several processes together. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We are designing this for franchise type implementation. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Supported by projects 1 and 2. This is project #2s urban counterpart and can be fitter to old warehouses, malls, or old store fronts. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Each facility is closer to the mouths it feeds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Products include chickens, fish, produce, composts, animal feeds, and its own energy. 
  <br>
  <br>
  This will be owned by those who build it and help work out the kinks to get it running smooth at each location. We are parting with 70-80% of the shares to employees. This is to maintain the agreement with cows and chickens, as they compliment each other.
  <br>
  <br>
      In fact, this has the potenial to produce extra energy its self... 
    
  <p>
    Again, thos is a closed-loop system to produce food. Nothing will be coming into the building at all. 
    <br>
    <br>
    My research is based upon various literature and resources that show specific stages of this design but seperatly in shorter processes.
    </p>
    
    I have combined several already practices creating a chain that, if the literature is accurate, allows us to produce food, electricity and its own feed stocks as well. It starts very simply as well (trade secret for now). 
    <br>
    <br>
    Furthermore, the wastes are mitigated by internal processes creating two or three useful and saleable products (depending on what kind of processing is set up). 
    <br>
    <br>
<hr>
    
    <h4>Project 4</h4> 
    Create all needed energy on site. 
    <br>
    <br>
    We intend to test several designs of energy storage and generation north of Edmonton (for viability). 
    <br>
    <br>
    Solar may make sense in the summer here but it certainly doesn't make sense in the winter when there is only 5 or 6 hours of decent sunlight a day. The rest is night.

  <h3>
    I'm confused, if we can grow food for way less than why do we pay so much?
  </h3>
    
  
  
  <i>That</i>, my good friend, is an excellent question.
  

  <p>
    Will food ever cost less?
  </p>
  
  
    Maybe...
    <br>
    I mean, hopefully, if I have anything to do about it then yes. 
    
<hr>
    
  <h3> 
    Municipal governments, our streets and hunger:
  </h3>
    
    
    Think about this. If cities had planted food in their boulevards, like berry and fruit bushes, instead of the trees they did, and they did so for one out of every 10 trees... today there would be hundreds of thousands, probably millions of food producing trees and shrubs spread accross countless streets in cities, towns, villages, and urban areas...
    <br>
    <br>
    What then? 
    <br>
    <br>
    Don't you think that some, if not many of the millions of hungry people would be less hungry?
    <br>
    <br>
    Fact is that the money was spent buying those trees anyways... so why not have spent it on food plants that can feed citizens?!?
