        Most important to me is to be ale to share. I hope that this content can be for your learning purposes also. For this reason I intend to provide resources for many catagories.

          I want you to be able to grow high quality food (or cannabis) with the ease that it should be.

        <h3>About Literature and the Scientific Method:</h3>

        <p>
        Some may find literature to be really boring stuff to read. It can be, but please try to read the first sections of these papers. Papers follow the <a href="https://www.amnh.org/explore/videos/the-scientific-process" target=""blank">scientific method (Important)</a> which means that what you learn has been through a set of steps to test and validate its reliability.
